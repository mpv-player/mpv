/**
 * @brief This file provides two macros, mp_assert and mp_require, used to check
 * for conditions that should never occur.
 *
 * The mp_assert macro is a convenience wrapper around the standard assert,
 * which also sinks unused variables to prevent compiler warnings. It should be
 * used for debugging purposes only to check for conditions that should never
 * occur. This macro can be disabled in release builds by defining NDEBUG and
 * should not be used for error handling.
 *
 * The mp_require macro is similar to mp_assert but more strict. It enforces
 * critical assertions even in release builds. If the condition is not met, this
 * macro will abort the program, making it suitable for error handling in cases
 * where recovery is impossible. Note that this macro does not log any messages
 * to keep as small footprint as possible in NDEBUG builds.
