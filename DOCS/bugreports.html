<H2>How to fix bugs</H2>

<P>If you feel have the necessary skills you are invited to have a go at fixing
  the bug yourself.  Or maybe you already did that?  Please read
  <A HREF="tech/patches.txt">this short document</A> to find out how to get
  your code included in <B>MPlayer</B>. The people on the
  <A HREF="http://mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/mplayer-dev-eng">mplayer-dev-eng</A>
  mailing list will assist you if you have questions.</P>


<H2>How to report bugs</H2>

<P>First of all please try the latest CVS version of <B>MPlayer</B> as your bug
  might already be fixed there. CVS instructions can be found at the bottom of
  <A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/dload.html">this page</A> or in the
  README. If this did not help please refer to
  <A HREF="documentation.html#known_bugs">the list of known bugs</A> and the
  rest of the documentation. If your problem is not known or not solvable by our
  instructions, then please report the bug.</P>

<P>Please do not send bug reports privately to individual developers.  This is
  community work and thus there might be several people interested in it.
  Sometimes other users already experienced your troubles and know how to
  circumvent a problem even if it is a bug in <B>MPlayer</B> code.</P>

<P>Please describe your problem in as much detail as possible. Do a little
  detective work to narrow down the circumstances under which the problem
  occurs. Does the bug only show up in certain situations? Is it specific to
  certain files or file types? Does it occur with only one codec or is it codec
  independent? Can you reproduce it with all output drivers? The more
  information you provide the better are our chances at fixing your problem.
  Please do not forget to also include the valuable information requested below,
  we will be unable to properly diagnose your problem otherwise.</P>

<P>An excellent and well written guide to asking questions in public forums is
  <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask
  Questions The Smart Way</A> by Eric S. Raymond. If you follow these guidelines
  you should be safe. But please understand that we all follow the mailing lists
  voluntarily in our free time. We are very busy and cannot guarantee that you
  will get a solution for your problem or even an answer.</P>

      <LI>libpng version</LI>
      <LI>GUI situation in which the bug occurs</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>


<H4>Hardware &amp; drivers:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>CPU info (this works on Linux only):<BR>
    <CODE>cat /proc/cpuinfo</CODE></LI>
  <LI>Video card manufacturer and model, e.g.:
    <UL>
      <LI>ASUS V3800U chip: nVidia TNT2 Ultra pro 32MB SDRAM</LI>
      <LI>Matrox G400 DH 32MB SGRAM</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>

    <UL>
      <LI>X built-in driver</LI>
      <LI>nVidia 0.9.623</LI>
      <LI>Utah-GLX CVS 2001-02-17</LI>

      <LI>Creative SBLive! Gold with OSS driver from oss.creative.com</LI>
      <LI>Creative SB16 with kernel OSS drivers</LI>
      <LI>GUS PnP with ALSA OSS emulation</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>If in doubt include <CODE>lspci -vv</CODE> output on Linux systems.</LI>
</UL>


<H4>For compilation problems/errors</H4>

Please include these files:

<UL>
  <LI>configure.log</LI>
  <LI>config.h</LI>
  <LI>config.mak</LI>
  <LI>libvo/config.mak</LI>
</UL>


<H4>For playback problems</H4>

<P>Please include the output of <B>MPlayer</B> at verbosity level 1, but
  remember to <B>not truncate the output</B> when you paste it into your mail.
  The developers need all of the messages to properly diagnose a problem. You
  can direct the output into a file like this:</P>

<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mplayer -v [options] [filename] &amp;&gt; mplayer.log</CODE></P>

<P>If your problem is specific to one or more files, then please upload the
  offender(s) to:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/">ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/</A></P>

<P>Also upload a small text file having the same base name as your file
  with a .txt extension. Describe the problem you are having with the
  particular file there and include your email address as well as the output
  of <B>MPlayer</B> at verbosity level 1. Usually the first 1-5 MB of a file are
  enough to reproduce the problem, but to be sure we ask you to:</P>

<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dd if=yourfile of=smallfile bs=1024k count=5</CODE></P>

<P>It will take the  first five megabytes of <STRONG>'your-file'</STRONG> and
  write it to <STRONG>'small-file'</STRONG>. Then try again on this small file
  and if the bug still shows up your sample is sufficient for us. Please
  <STRONG>do not ever</STRONG> send such files via mail! Upload it, and send
  only the path/filename of the file on the FTP-server. If the file is
  accessible on the net, then sending the <STRONG>exact</STRONG> URL is
  sufficient.</P>


<H4>For crashes</H4>

<P>If you have a core dump of the crash continue reading the next paragraph,
  otherwise skip it.</P>


<H4>How to extract meaningful information from a core dump</H4>

<P>Please create following command file:</P>

<P><CODE>disass $eip-32 $eip+32<BR>
  printf "eax=%08lX\n",$eax<BR>
  printf "ebx=%08lX\n",$ebx<BR>
  printf "ecx=%08lX\n",$ecx<BR>
  printf "edx=%08lX\n",$edx<BR>
  printf "esp=%08lX\n",$esp<BR>
  printf "ebp=%08lX\n",$ebp<BR>
  printf "edi=%08lX\n",$edi<BR>
  printf "esi=%08lX\n",$esi</CODE></P>

<P>Then simply execute the following on your command line:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>gdb mplayer --core=core -batch --command=command_file &gt; mplayer.bug</CODE></P>


<H4>How to conserve information about a reproducible crash</H4>

Recompile <B>MPlayer</B> with debugging code enabled:

<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./configure --enable-debug=3<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make</CODE></P>

and then run <B>MPlayer</B> within gdb using:

<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gdb mplayer</CODE></P>

You are now within gdb. Type:

<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run -v [options-to-mplayer] filename</code></P>

and reproduce your crash. As soon as you did it, gdb will
return you to the command line prompt where you have to enter

<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bt<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disass $eip-32 $eip+32</CODE></P>

and send the complete output to us.


<H3>General note</H3>

<P>If something is quite big (logs for instance) then it is better to upload
  it to the FTP server in a compressed format (gzip and bzip preferred) and
  include only the path and filename in your bug report.</P>


<H2>I know what I am doing...</H2>

<P>If you created a proper bug report following the steps above and you are
  confident it is a bug in <B>MPlayer</B>, not a compiler problem or broken
  file, you have already read the documentation and you could not find a
  solution, your sound drivers are OK, then you might want to subscribe to the
  mplayer-advusers list and send your bug report there to get a better and
  faster answer.<BR><BR> 
  Please be advised that if you post newbie questions or questions answered
  in the manual there, you will be ignored or flamed instead of getting an
  appropriate answer.<BR>
  So do not flame us and  subscribe to -advusers only if you really know
  what you are doing and feel like being an advanced <B>MPlayer</B> user or
  developer.  If you meet these criteria it should not be difficult to find
  out how to subscribe...</P>
