<P><B>How to report bugs?</B></P>

<P>First, try the latest CVS, maybe your bug is already fixed. CVS download
instructions (easy) can be found on our homepage.</P>

<P>If it didn't help: read <A HREF="documentation.html#D">Appendix D</A>, and other docs. If your problem isn't
known or isn't solved by our instructions, then report the bug:</P>

<P><B>Where?</B></P>

<P>Subscribe to the mplayer-users mailing list:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/mplayer-users">http://mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/mplayer-users</A><BR>
and send your bugreport to:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="mailto:mplayer-users@mplayerhq.hu">mplayer-users@mplayerhq.hu</A><BR>
We won't CC: so please subscribe!!!</P>

<P>Don't send bugreports private, directly to author's address!!!
We are working together on code, so everyone is interested in it.
BTW many times other users know the solution (system config probs,
bad drivers etc), even when we think it's a bug in our code.
The language of this list is ENGLISH!</P>

<P>Please describe your problem in details, examples etc, and don't
forget to include these:</P>

<P><B>What?</B></P>

<P><B><I>1. The system info what we always want:</I></B></P>

<UL>
<LI>linux distribution<BR>
examples:<UL>
    <LI>RedHat 7.1
    <LI>Slackware 7.0 + devel packs from 7.1 ...</UL>
<LI>kernel version:<BR>
    <CODE>uname -a</CODE>
<LI>libc version:<BR>
    <CODE>ls -l /lib/libc[.-]*</CODE>
<LI>X version:<BR>
    <CODE>X -version</CODE>
<LI>gcc and ld version:<BR>
    <CODE>gcc -v<BR>
    ld -v</CODE>
<LI>binutils version:<BR>
    <CODE>as --version</CODE>
</UL>

<P><B><I>2. Hardware & drivers:</I></B></P>

<UL>
<LI>CPU info:<BR>
    <CODE>cat /proc/cpuinfo</CODE>
<LI>video card manufacturer and model<BR>
    examples:<BR><UL>
    <LI>ASUS V3800U chip: nVidia TNT2 Ultra pro 32MB SDRAM
    <LI>Matrox G400 DH 32MB SGRAM</UL>
<LI>video driver type&version<BR>
    examples:<UL>
    <LI>X built-in driver
    <LI>nvidia 0.9.623
    <LI>Utah-GLX CVS 2001-02-17
    <LI>DRI from X 4.0.3</UL>
<LI>sound card type & driver<BR>
    examples:<BR><UL>
    <LI>Creative SBLive! Gold with OSS driver from oss.creative.com
    <LI>Creative SB16 with OSS drivers of kernel
    <LI>GUS PnP with ALSA OSS emulation</UL>
<LI>if you are unsure, attach output of lspci -v
</UL>

<P><B>For compiling problems/errors</B></P>

<P><B><I>3. these files:</I></B></P>
<UL><LI>configure.log
<LI>config.h
<LI>config.mak
<LI>libvo/config.mak
</UL>

<P><B>For playback problems:</B></P>

<P><B><I>3. Output of mplayer at verbose level 1 (-v)</I></B></P>
<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mplayer -v [options] filename &amp;&gt; mplayer.log</CODE></P>
  
<P><B><I>4. If the problem is specific to one or a few files,
  then please upload that file to:</I></B></P>
<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/</CODE></P>
  Also upload a small .txt file with the same name as your file (+ .txt extension),
  containing problem description, mplayer -v file output, and your email address!<BR>
  Usually first 1-5 MB of the file is enough to reproduce
  the problem, but first you should try it:
<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dd if=yourfile of=smallfile bs=1024k count=5</CODE></P>
  (it will cut first 5 MB of 'yourfile' and save to 'smallfile')
  Then try again on this small file, and if bug still exists
  then it's enough to upload this small file.<BR>
  NEVER send such files via mail! Upload it, and send only
  the path/filename of the file on the FTP.
  If the file is accessible on the net, then sending the
  _exact_ URL is enough!

<P><B><I>5. For crashes (segfault, SIGILL, signal 4 etc):</I></B></P>

<P><I>If you have coredump of the crash, see 5.a, else see 5.b:</I></P>

<P><B><I>5.a: Please print us coredump (if it was created).</I></B></P>

<P>Howto:
please create following command file:</P>

<P><CODE>disass $eip-32 $eip+32<BR>
printf "eax=%08lX\n",$eax<BR>
printf "ebx=%08lX\n",$ebx<BR>
printf "ecx=%08lX\n",$ecx<BR>
printf "edx=%08lX\n",$edx<BR>
printf "esp=%08lX\n",$esp<BR>
printf "ebp=%08lX\n",$ebp<BR>
printf "edi=%08lX\n",$edi<BR>
printf "esi=%08lX\n",$esi<BR>
</CODE></P>

<P>Then simply execute following command line:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>gdb mplayer --core=core -batch --command=command_file >mplayer.bug</CODE></P>

<P><B><I>5.b.: run MPlayer in gdb:</I></B></P>
<P>Re-compile mplayer with debugging code enabled:<BR>
./configure --enable-debug<BR>
make
</P>
<P>[at root/user shell prompt:]<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE># gdb mplayer</CODE><BR>
[at gdb prompt:]<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>&gt; run -v [options-to-mplayer] filename</CODE><BR>
  ... (wait until it will crash)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>&gt; bt</CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>&gt; disass $eip-32 $eip+32</CODE><BR>
Send us the full output of the above things!
</P>

<P><B>In general:</B></P>

<P>If something is big (logs etc) then it's better to upload to the ftp
(gzipped), and include only path/filename in the bugreport!</P>

<P><B>I know what am I doing...</B></P>

<P>If you created a proper bugreport following the above steps, and you are
sure it's mplayer bug, not compiler's problem or broken file, you've already
readed through docs and you didn't find the solution, your sound drivers are ok,
then you may want to subscribe to the mplayer-advusers list and send your
bugreport there to get better and faster answer. But BE WARNED: if you post
newbie or rtfm-type questions there, you'll be immediatelly banned, instead or
getting answered!!! So don't flame us, subscribe -advusers only if you really
know what are you doing and you feel you as advanced mplayer user or developer.
(and about how to subscribe: find it out! if you're really an advanced user,
it shouldn't be a problem for you...)
