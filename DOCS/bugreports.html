<P><B>How to report bugs?</B></P>

<P>First of all please try the latest CVS version of <B>MPlayer</B> as your bug
might already be fixed there. CVS instructions can be found at the bottom of
<A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/dload.html">this page</A>.</P>

<P>If this did not help please refer to <A HREF="documentation.html#D">Appendix D</A>
and the rest of the documentation. If your problem is not known or not solvable by
our instructions, then please report the bug.</P>

<P>If you feel have the necessary skills you are invited to have a go at fixing
the bug yourself.  Or maybe you already did that?  Please read
<A HREF="tech/patches.txt">this short document</A> to find out how to get your
code included in <B>MPlayer</B>. The people on the
<A HREF="http://mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/mplayer-dev-eng">mplayer-dev-eng</A>
mailing list can assist you if you have questions.</P>

<P><B>Where to report bugs?</B></P>

<P>Subscribe to the mplayer-users mailing list:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/mplayer-users">http://mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/mplayer-users</A><BR>
and send your bug report to:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="mailto:mplayer-users@mplayerhq.hu">mplayer-users@mplayerhq.hu</A></P>

<P>The language of this list is <B>English</B>. Please follow the standard
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt">Netiquette Guidelines</A> and
<B>do not send HTML mail</B> to any of our mailing lists.  You will only get
ignored or banned. Also note that we will not individually CC (carbon-copy)
people so it is a good idea to subscribe to actually receive your answer.</P>

<P>Please do not send bug reports privately to individual developers.  This is
community work and thus there might be several people interested in it.
Also sometimes other users already experienced your troubles and have a
solution in hand how to circumvent a problem even if it is a bug in <B>MPlayer</B>
code.</P>

<P>Please describe your problem in as much detail as possible. Do a little
detective work to narrow down the circumstances under which the problem occurs.
Does the bug only show up in certain situations? Is it specific to certain files
or file types? Does it occur with only one codec or is it codec independent?
Can you reproduce it with all output drivers? The more information you provide
the better are our chances at fixing your problem. Please do not forget to
also include the valuable information requested below, we will probably be
unable to properly diagnose your bug otherwise.</P>

<P><B>What to report?</B></P>

<P><B>Hardware &amp; drivers</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>CPU info (this works on Linux only):<BR>
    <CODE>cat /proc/cpuinfo</CODE></LI>
<LI>Video card manufacturer and model, e.g.:
    <UL>
        <LI>ASUS V3800U chip: nVidia TNT2 Ultra pro 32MB SDRAM</LI>
        <LI>Matrox G400 DH 32MB SGRAM</LI>

    <UL>
        <LI>X built-in driver</LI>
        <LI>nVidia 0.9.623</LI>

        <LI>GUS PnP with ALSA OSS emulation</LI>
    </UL>
</LI>
<LI>If in doubt include <CODE>lspci -vv</CODE> output on Linux systems.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>For compilation problems/errors</B></P>

<P><B>Please include these files:</B></P>
<UL>
  <LI>configure.log</LI>
  <LI>config.h</LI>
  <LI>config.mak</LI>
  <LI>libvo/config.mak</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>For playback problems</B></P>

<P>Please include the output of <B>MPlayer</B> at verbosity level 1, but
remember to <B>not truncate the output</B> when you paste it into your mail. The
developers need all of the messages to properly diagnose a problem. You can
direct the output into a file like this:</P>

<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mplayer -v [options] [filename] &amp;&gt; mplayer.log</CODE></P>

<P>If your problem is specific to one or more files, then please upload the
offender(s) to:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/">ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/</A></P>

<P>Also upload a small text file having the same base name as your file
with a .txt extension. Describe the problem you are having with the
particular file there and include your email address as well as the output
of <B>MPlayer</B> at verbosity level 1.<BR> 
Usually the first 1-5 MB of a file are enough to reproduce the problem,
but to be sure we ask you to:
<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dd if=yourfile of=smallfile bs=1024k count=5</CODE></P>

<P>It will take the  first five megabytes of <STRONG>'your-file'</STRONG> and
write it to <STRONG>'small-file'</STRONG>.<BR>
Then try again on this small file and if the bug still shows up 
your sample is sufficient for us.<BR>
Please <STRONG>do not ever</STRONG> send such files via mail! Upload it,
and send only the path/filename of the file on the FTP-server.<BR>
If the file is accessible on the net, then sending the
<STRONG>exact</STRONG> URL is sufficient.</P>

<P><B>For crashes</B></P>

<P>If you have a core dump of the crash continue reading the next paragraph,
otherwise skip it.</P>

<P><B>How to extract meaningful information from a core dump</B></P>

<P>Please create following command file:</P>

<P><CODE>disass $eip-32 $eip+32<BR>
printf "eax=%08lX\n",$eax<BR>
printf "ebx=%08lX\n",$ebx<BR>
printf "ecx=%08lX\n",$ecx<BR>
printf "edx=%08lX\n",$edx<BR>
printf "esp=%08lX\n",$esp<BR>
printf "ebp=%08lX\n",$ebp<BR>
printf "edi=%08lX\n",$edi<BR>
printf "esi=%08lX\n",$esi<BR>
</CODE></P>

<P>Then simply execute the following on your command line:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>gdb mplayer --core=core -batch --command=command_file &gt; mplayer.bug</CODE></P>

<P><B>How to conserve information about a reproducible crash</B></P>
<P>Recompile <B>MPlayer</B> with debugging code enabled:</P>
<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./configure --enable-debug=3<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make</CODE></P>
and then run <B>MPlayer</B> within gdb using:
<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gdb mplayer</CODE></P>

<P>You are now within gdb. Type:</P>
<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run -v [options-to-mplayer] filename</code></P>
and reproduce your crash. As soon as you did it, gdb will
return you to the command line prompt where you have to enter
<P><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disass $eip-32 $eip+32</CODE></P>
and send the complete output to us.

<P><B>General note</B></P>

<P>If something is quite big (logs for instance) then it is better to upload
it to the FTP server in a compressed format (gzip and bzip preferred) and
include only the path and filename in your bug report.</P>

<P><B>I know what I am doing...</B></P>

<P>If you created a proper bug report following the steps above and you are
confident it is a bug in <B>MPlayer</B>, not a compiler problem or broken file,
you have already read the documentation and you could not find a solution,
your sound drivers are OK, then you might want to subscribe to the
mplayer-advusers list and send your bug report there to get a better and
faster answer.<BR><BR> 
Please be advised that if you post newbie questions or questions answered
in the manual there, you will be ignored or flamed instead of getting an
appropriate answer.<BR>
So do not flame us and  subscribe to -advusers only if you really know
what you are doing and feel like being an advanced <B>MPlayer</B> user or
developer.  If you meet these criteria it should not be difficult to find
out how to subscribe...
