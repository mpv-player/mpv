How to enable DivX4Linux support?
=================================

1. Download the codec:
  http://download.projectmayo.com/dnload/divx4linux/divx4linux-20010718.zip
  
2. Unpack it, and copy files to their place:
 cp libdivxdecore.so.0.0.0 /usr/local/lib/
 ln -s /usr/local/lib/libdivxdecore.so.0.0.0 /usr/local/lib/libdivxdecore.so.0
 ln -s /usr/local/lib/libdivxdecore.so.0 /usr/local/lib/libdivxdecore.so
 ldconfig
 cp decore.h /usr/local/include/

3. Run mplayer's ./configure
   Change #undef NEW_DECORE to #define NEW_DECORE in config.h
   Change #define MPEG12_POSTPROC to #undef MPEG12_POSTPROC in config.h
   Change DECORE_LIBS in config.mak to be:
      DECORE_LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib -ldivxdecore

4. Compile mplayer

5. How to enable it?
 It's a bit tricky. As it conflicts with opendivx (it's API is very
 similar to opendivx's), opendivx code is disabled, and teh opendivx
 driver calls this library too.
 You have 2 choices:
   -vc odivx : using divx4 codec as a new version of opendivx.
               in this case it produces YV12 image in its own buffer,
	       and MPlayer (libvo) does colorspace conversion.
   -vc divx4 : using divx4 codec's colorspace conversion.
               in this mode, you can use YUY2/UYVY too.
 Note: for YV12 (planar YUV 4:2:0) -vc odivx is faster, for packed
 YUV modes (YUY2, UYVY) use -vc divx4. For RGB modes you can choose,
 I think their speed is the same. Maybe it depends on current bpp.

 Note: it supports postprocessing too, but range of values is strange:
      0  = no postproc
      10 .. 20 = postproc, normal (like level 2 with divxds)
      30 .. 60 = hard postproc, eats many cpu.  (like level 4 with divxds)
