 - MPlayer is mostly intended for OSS, until we change to libxmm
 - use at least 2.4 if possible, 2.2 isn't tested
 - if sound clicks when playing from CD-ROM, turn on IRQ unmasking !
   for example "hdparm -u1 /dev/cdrom" (see "man hdparm" !!!)
   This is recommended anyways... (for XMMS, etc...)
   Read DOCS/CDROM .
 - don't use your soundcard by other application ( for ex. XMMS ) !
   if you use ESD, start MPlayer with the esddsp utility !
 - Please tell us how MPlayer and your soundcard(s) worked together!
