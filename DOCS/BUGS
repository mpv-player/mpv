Known bugs:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Special system/cpu-specific bugs/problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. SIGILL (signal 4) in draw_frame, on P3 (mostly 2.2.x kernels):
  Problem: movups is crashing in libvo/fastmemcpy.h
  Workaround:  ./configure --disable-fastmemcpy

2. No image (black image) in RGB 16bpp (x11,dga,fbdev,svga) playing
   MPEG files on SMP machine:
  Problem: bug(?) in MMX YV12->RGB16 converter code
  Workaround: ./configure --disable-mmx

3. SIGILL or other fault at loading l3codeca.acm:
  Problem: shared libs are loaded to 0x00100000 instead of 0x40000000
  Workaround: mplayer -afm 1 ...

Please contact me if you experienced any of the above problems. We need
people to test fixes and send us as many system details information as
possible (kernel+libc+gcc+binutils version, test results, /proc/cpuinfo etc)
because they are system-dependent problems and aren't reproducable here.
Please tell me if you can fix them or you are only user.
Unfortunately we can't reproduce these here, so it's very hard to fix.

Various A-V sync and other audio problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
General audio delay or jerky sound (exists with all or many files):
- bad select() in audio driver (including ALSA's OSS emulation)
  Workaround: ./configure --disable-select
- audio buffer problems
  Workaround:  mplayer -abs option
- slow machine (cpu or vga)
  try with -vo null, if it plays well, then you has slow VGA card/driver:
  Workaround: buy a faster card or read DOCS/VIDEOCARDS about how to speed up

Audio delay specific to one or a few files:
- bad file (pleae upload the file, so we can check & fix)
  Workaround: -ni and/or -bps options
              -delay option or +/- keys at runtime to adjuts delay
- your soundcard doesn't support 48khz playback
  Workaround: buy a better soundcard...
- file has VBR mp3 audio
  Workaround: mplayer -mc 0

After many > or ^ (fast forward) audio vs. video is going out of sync (ASF/AVI)
- bug in mplayer code (a-v sync probs after seek... not really bug but
  my avi/asf seeking code is not perfect yet)

Signal 11 in decode_audio:
- mp3lib doesn't handle (yet) well bad/broken audio streams
  Workaround: -afm 4
- if it's still bad, try with -nosound  [and report the bug, see BUGREPORTS]

No sound at all:
- your file uses a not supported codec
  Workaround: read DOCS/CODECS, and help us adding support for it

Video-out problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First note: options -fs -vm and -zoom are just recommendations, not (yet)
supported by all drivers. So it isn't a bug if it doesn't work.
Only a few driver supports scaling/zooming, don't except this from x11 or dga.
