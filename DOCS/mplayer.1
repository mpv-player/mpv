.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mplayer
Yes. Yet another movie player for linux.
What is the special with this? It works, at least for me :)
I've tried lots of players under linux (mtv,xmps,dvdview,livid/oms,VideoLAN,
xine,xanim,avifile,xmmp) but they all have some problem. Mostly with
special files or with audio/video sync. Most of them is unable to play
both mpeg1, mpeg2 and avi (DivX) files. Many players have image quality
or speed problems too. So I've decided to write/modify one...
.LP
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
MPlayer works out-of-the-box, so you generally don't have to mess with
any options.
.TP
.I NOTE
Every "flag" option has "noflag" pair, e.g. -fs opposite is -nofs
.TP
.BI \-vo\ output\ driver
select output driver

you can get the list of available drivers executing
.I mplayer -vo help

.TP
.B \-vcd\ track
play video cd track from device instead of plain file
.TP
.B \-dvd\ device
specify DVD-ROM drive to use for MPEG2 decoding.
(use *_only_* when playing from DVD!)
.TP
.B \-nosound
don't play sound
.TP
.B \-fs
fullscreen playing (centers movie, and makes black
bands around it)
.TP
.B \-vm
use XF86VidMode extension for mode changing
.TP
.B \-zoom
use software scaling, where available
.TP
.B \-x\ x
scale image to x width [if driver suppports!]
.TP
.B \-y\ y
scale image to y height
.TP
.B \-xy\ factor
scale image by <factor>
.TP
.B \-dsp\ device
select another DSP output device
.TP
.B \-pp\ quality
apply postprocess filter on decoded image.
You need a STRONG CPU in order to use this!
The supported formats and settings are:

        MPEG 1/2   0 (none), 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
        OpenDivX   0 (none), 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
        DivX       0 (none), 1, 2, 3, 4

.I NOTE
Maybe less/more.

.I NOTE
You can use this with OpenDivX encoding too! See ALPHA/BETA CODE section.
.TP
.B \-ffactor\ number
resample alphamap of the font. Can be:

        0    plain white fonts
        0.75 very narrow black outline [default]
        1    narrow black outline
        10   bold black outline
.TP
.B \-sub\ file
use/display this subtitle file
.TP
.B \-subfps\ rate
specify frame/sec rate of subtitle file
(ONLY for frame-based SUB files, i.e. NOT MicroDVD format!)
(default: the same as the movie)
.TP
.B \-subdelay\ sec
delays subtitles by <sec> seconds. Can be negative.
.IP
.SH "ADVANCED OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
These options can help you solve your particular problem.. Also, see the DOCS!
.TP
.B \-afm <1-5>
force audio format  1:MPEG 2:PCM 3:AC3 4:Win32 5:aLaw

.I NOTE
With DivX AVIs with MP3 audio, you can choose whether to use MP3LIB (option 1),
or Win32 DLL l3codeca.acm (option 4) (default). On CPUs with the 3DNow!
instruction set, the first gives more performance. Your mileage may vary.
.TP
.B \-sb\ position
seek to byte position
.B \-ss\ second
seek to second position
.TP
.B \-abs\ bytes
audio buffer size (in bytes, default: measuring)
.TP
.B \-delay\ secs
audio delay in seconds (may be +/- float value)
.TP
.B \-bps
use avg. byte/sec value for A-V sync (AVI)
.TP
.B \-aid\ id
select audio channel [MPG: 0-31  AVI: 1-99]
.TP
.B \-vid\ id
select video channel [MPG: 0-15  AVI:  -- ]
.TP
.B \-fps\ value
force frame rate (if value is wrong in the header)
.TP
.B \-mc\ seconds/5frame
maximum sync correction per 5 frames (in seconds)
.TP
.B \-ni
force usage of non-interleaved AVI parser
.TP
.B \-include
specify config file to be parsed after the default
.TP
.B \-z\ <0-8>
specifies compression level for PNG output
          0 : no compression
          8 : max compression
.TP
.B \-idx
rebuilds INDEX of the AVI. Useful with broken downloads, or badly
created AVIs.
.TP
.B \-forceidx
force rebuilding of INDEX. Useful for testing, or AVIs with bad
indexes.
.TP
.B \-nodshow
disables usage of DirectShow video codecs
.TP
.B \-sdl\ driver
specify SDL driver to use. For example: aalib, dga, fbdev, svga, x11, ggi
.TP
.B \-noxv
disable XVideo hardware acceleration (with SDL only!)
.TP
.B \-forcexv
force using XVideo (SDL!)
.TP
.B \-dumpaudio
writes audio stream of the file to ./stream.dump (mostly usable
with mpeg/ac3)
.TP
.B \-noframedrop
no frame dropping : every frame is played, audio may skip (default)
.TP
.B \-framedrop
frame dropping : decode all frames, video may skip
.TP
.B \-hardframe
hard frame dropping : skip even decoding (when using with DivX also
specify -nodshow !!!) (also can be turned on/off with the 'd' key runtime)

.SH "ALPHA/BETA CODE"
.TP
.I NOTE
These are included in this manpage just for completeness! If you don't
know what are these, you DON'T need these! In either case, double-check DOCS!
.TP
.B \-br\ rate
used with '-vo odivx' .
Specifies the bitrate to encode OpenDivx at
(in bits! e.g: 780000).
.TP
.B \-encode\ file
used with '-vo odivx' .
Specifies the output OpenDivX file. Won't overwrite.
.TP
.B \-dumpvideo
dump video stream to ./stream.dump (only with MPEG-PS) (not very usable)
.TP
.B \-dumpsub
dumps subtitles from VOB to file (not very usable)

.TP
.I NOTE
These keys may/may not work, depending on your video output driver.
.TP

p or SPACE      pause movie (press any key)

q or ESC        stop playing and quit program

+ or -          adjust audio delay by +/- 0.1 second

/ or *          decrease/increase volume

.SH FILES AND DIRECTORIES
.TP
.I CONFIG FILES
Settings are stored system-wide in the /etc/mplayer.conf file,
and per-user in $HOME/.mplayer/config. The directory
$HOME/.mplayer and the 'config' are created if doesn't exist.

.I FONTS
Fonts are searched in $HOME/.mplayer/font. There must be a font.desc
file, and files with .RAW extension.
.TP

Sub files are searched in $HOME/.mplayer/sub, and in the directory
of the movie. (TODO)
.IP
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Just launch it! :)
