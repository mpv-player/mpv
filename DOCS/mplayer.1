.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mplayer
Yes. Yet another movie player for linux.
What is the special with this? It works, at least for me :)
I've tried lots of players under linux (mtv,xmps,dvdview,livid/oms,VideoLAN,
xine,xanim,avifile,xmmp) but they all have some problem. Mostly with
special files or with audio/video sync. Most of them is unable to play
both mpeg1, mpeg2 and avi (DivX) files. Many players have image quality
or speed problems too. So I've decided to write/modify one...
.LP
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
MPlayer works out-of-the-box, so you generally don't have to mess with
any options.
.TP
.I NOTE
Every "flag" option has "noflag" pair, e.g. -fs opposite is -nofs
.TP
.B \-vo\ <driver>[:<device>]
select video output driver and optinaly device. "device" is valid with
SDL and GGI too, it means sub-driver then (for example: -vo sdl:aalib).

you can get the list of available drivers executing
.I mplayer -vo help

.TP
.B \-ao\ <driver>[:<device>]
select audio output driver and optinaly device. "device" is valid with
SDL and GGI too, it means sub-driver then (for example: -vo sdl:esd).

If using OSS, you can specify which sound device to use like this :
-ao oss:/dev/dsp1     (replaces the old -dsp option)

you can get the list of available drivers executing
.I mplayer -ao help

.TP
.B \-vcd\ track
play video cd track from device instead of plain file
.TP
.B \-dvdauth\ device
specify DVD-ROM drive to use for MPEG2 decoding.
(use *_only_* when playing from DVD!)
.TP
.B \-nosound
don't play sound
.TP
.B \-fs
fullscreen playing (centers movie, and makes black
bands around it)
.TP
.B \-vm
use XF86VidMode extension for mode changing
.TP
.B \-zoom
use software scaling, where available (use with -nofs)
.TP
.B \-x\ x
scale image to x width [if driver suppports!]
.TP
.B \-y\ y
scale image to y height
.TP
.B \-xy\ factor
scale image by <factor>
.TP
.B \-pp\ quality
apply postprocess filter on decoded image.
You need a STRONG CPU in order to use this!
The supported formats and settings are:

        MPEG 1/2   0 (none), 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
        OpenDivX   0 (none), 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
        DivX       0 (none), 1, 2, 3, 4

.I NOTE
Maybe less/more.
.TP
.B \-autoq\ quality
dynamically changes the level of postprocess, depending on spare CPU
time available. Uses the same value ranges as -pp . The number you
specify will be the maximum level used. Usually you can use some big
number.
.TP
.B \-ffactor\ number
resample alphamap of the font. Can be:

        0    plain white fonts
        0.75 very narrow black outline [default]
        1    narrow black outline
        10   bold black outline
.TP
.B \-sub\ file
use/display this subtitle file
.TP
.B \-subfps\ rate
specify frame/sec rate of subtitle file
(ONLY for frame-based SUB files, i.e. NOT MicroDVD format!)
(default: the same as the movie)
.TP
.B \-subdelay\ sec
delays subtitles by <sec> seconds. Can be negative.
.TP
.B \-osdlevel\ level
specifies which mode the OSD should start in (0 : none, 1 : seek, 2: seek+timer)
(default = 2)
.TP
.B \-lircconf\ configfile
specifies a configfile for LIRC (see http://www.lirc.org) if you don't like the default ~/.lircrc 
.IP
.SH "ADVANCED OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
These options can help you solve your particular problem.. Also, see the DOCS!
.TP
.B \-vc <name>
force usage of a specific video codec, according to its name in codecs.conf,
for example :

    -vc divx       use VFW DivX codec
    -vc divxds     use DirectShow DivX codec
    -vc ffdivx     use libavcodec's DivX codec
    -vc divx4      use ProjectMayo's DivX codec
.TP
.B \-ac <name>
force usage of a specific audio codec, according to its name in codecs.conf,
for example :

    -vfm 3         use OpenDivX codec (YV12)
                   (same as -vc odivx but fallback)
    -vfm 4         use DirectShow (Win32) codecs
    -vfm 5         use libavcodec codecs
    -vfm 7         use DivX4Linux codec (YUY2)
                   (same as -vc divx4 but fallback)

NOTE : type 3 and 7 now contains just the one same codec, then OpenDivX 4.0
beta. For difference between them and when to use which, check the OpenDivX
section in the documentation.
.TP

.SH FILES AND DIRECTORIES
.TP
.I CONFIG FILES
Settings are stored system-wide in the /etc/mplayer.conf file,
and per-user in $HOME/.mplayer/config. The directory
$HOME/.mplayer and the 'config' are created if doesn't exist.
.TP
.I FONTS
Fonts are searched in $HOME/.mplayer/font. There must be a font.desc
file, and files with .RAW extension.
.TP
.I SUBTITLE FILES
MPlayer currently supports 6 subtitle formats : MicroDVD, SubRip, unnamed,
SAMI (smi), vplayer, RealMedia RT, ssa (Sub Station Alpha).
Sub files are searched in this priority : (for example /mnt/cdrom/movie.avi)
    /mnt/cdrom/movie.sub
        (SUB/srt/SRT/smi/SMI/rt/RT/txt/TXT)
    $HOME/.mplayer/sub/movie.sub
        (SUB/srt/SRT/smi/SMI/rt/RT/txt/TXT)
    $HOME/.mplayer/default.sub
