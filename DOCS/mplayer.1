.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mplayer
is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices and non\-x86 CPUs, see
the documentation).
It plays most MPEG/\:VOB, AVI, ASF/\:WMA/\:WMV, RM, QT/\:MOV/\:MP4, OGG/\:OGM,
VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM and RoQ files, supported by many
native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs.
You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX\ 3/\:4/\:5 and even WMV movies,
too (without using the avifile library).
.PP
Another great feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output
drivers.
It works with X11, XV, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB, but you
can also use GGI, SDL (and this way all their drivers), VESA (on every VESA
compatible card, even without X11), some low level card-specific drivers (for
Matrox, 3Dfx and ATI) and some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the
Siemens DVB, DXR2 and DXR3/\:Hollywood+.
Most of them support software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in
fullscreen.
.PP
MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice big
antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls.
European/\:ISO 8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and Korean
fonts are supported along with 10 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, SubRip,
SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub and our own: MPsub) and DVD
subtitles (SPU streams, VobSub and Closed Captions).
.PP
.B mencoder
(MPlayer's Movie Encoder) is a simple movie encoder, designed to encode
MPlayer-playable movies (see above) to other MPlayer-playable formats (see
below).
It encodes to DivX4, XviD, one of the libavcodec codecs and PCM/\:MP3/\:VBRMP3
audio in 1, 2 or 3\ passes.
Furthermore it has stream copying abilities, a powerful plugin system (crop,
expand, flip, postprocess, rotate, scale, noise, rgb/\:yuv conversion) and
more.
.PP
.B gmplayer
is MPlayer with a graphical user interface.
It has the same options as MPlayer.

.
.SH "GENERAL NOTES"
.B Also see the HTML documentation!
.PP
Every 'flag' option has a 'noflag' counterpart, e.g.\& the opposite of the
\-fs option is \-nofs.
.PP
You can put all of the options in a configuration file which will be read
every time mplayer is run.
The system-wide configuration file 'mplayer.conf' is in your configuration
directory (e.g.\& /etc/\:mplayer or /usr/\:local/\:etc/\:mplayer), the user
specific one is '~/\:.mplayer/\:config'.
User specific options override system\-wide options and options given on the
command line override either.
The syntax of the configuration files is 'option=<value>', everything after a
\'#' is considered a comment.
Options that work without values can be enabled by setting them to 'yes' or
\'1' and disabled by setting them to 'no' or '0'.
Even suboptions can be specified in this way.

.I EXAMPLE:
.br
# Use Matrox driver by default.
.br
vo=xmga
.br
# I love practicing handstands while watching videos.
.br
flip=yes
.br
# Decode/\:encode multiple files from png, start it with -mf on
.br
mf= type=png:fps=25


.SH "PLAYER OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)"
.TP
.B \-autoq <quality> (use with \-vop pp)
Dynamically changes the level of postprocessing depending on available spare
CPU time.
The number you specify will be the maximum level used.
Usually you can use some big number.
You have to use \-vop pp without parameters in order to use this.
.TP
.B \-autosync <factor>
Gradually adjusts the A/\:V sync based on audio delay measurements.
Specifying \-autosync\ 0, the default, will cause frame timing to be based
entirely on audio delay measurements.
Specifying \-autosync\ 1 will do the same, but will subtly change the A/\:V
correction algorithm used.
An uneven video frame rate in a movie which plays fine with \-nosound can
often be helped by setting this to an integer value greater than 1.
The higher the value, the closer the timing will be to -nosound.
Try \-autosync\ 30 to smooth out problems with sound drivers which do
not implement a perfect audio delay measurement.
With this value, if large A/\:V sync offsets occur, they will only take about
1 or 2\ seconds to settle out.
This delay in reaction time to sudden A/\:V offsets should be the only
side-effect of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.
.TP
.B \-benchmark
Prints some statistics on CPU usage and dropped frames at the end.
Use in combination with \-nosound and \-vo null for benchmarking only the
video codec.
.TP
.B \-framedrop (also see \-hardframedrop)
Skips displaying some frames to maintain A/\:V sync on slow systems.
Decoding of B frames is also skipped and video filters are not used.
.TP
.B \-h, \-help, \-\-help
Show short summary of options.
.TP
.B \-hardframedrop
More intense frame dropping (breaks decoding).
Leads to image distortion!
.TP
.B \-identify
Show file parameters in easy parsable format.  The wrapper script
TOOLS/midentify suppresses the other mplayer output and (hopefully)
shellescapes the filenames.
.TP
.B \-input <commands>
This option can be used to configure certain parts of the input system.
Paths are relative to ~/\:.mplayer/.

.I NOTE:
.br
Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.
.br
Available commands are:

.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs conf=<file>
Read alternative input.conf.
If given without pathname, ~/\:.mplayer is assumed.
.IPs ar\-delay
Delay in msec before we start to autorepeat a key (0 to disable).
.IPs ar\-rate
How many key presses per second when we autorepeat.
.IPs keylist
Prints all keys that can be bound.
.IPs cmdlist
Prints all commands that can be bound.
.IPs js\-dev
Specifies the joystick device to use (default is /dev/\:input/\:js0).
.IPs file
Read commands from the given file. Mostly useful with a fifo.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-lircconf <configuration\ file>
Specifies a configuration file for LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control, see
http://www.lirc.org) if you don't like the default ~/\:.lircrc.
.TP
.B \-loop <number>
Loops movie playback <number> times.
0 means forever.
.TP
.B \-nojoystick
Turns off joystick support.
Default is on, if compiled in.
.TP
.B \-nolirc
Turns off LIRC support.
.TP
.B \-nortc \ \ 
Turns off usage of the Linux RTC (real-time clock \- /dev/\:rtc) as timing
mechanism.
.TP
.B \-playlist <file>
Play files according to a playlist (1 file per row or Winamp or ASX format).
.TP
.B \-quiet \ \ 
Display less output and status messages.
.TP
.B \-really\-quiet \ \ 
Display even less output and status messages.
.TP
.B \-rnd \ \ 
Play files in random order.
.TP
.B \-sdp
Specifies that the input file is a SDP ('Session Description Protocol')
file that describes an RTP session (see http://www.live.com/mplayer/).
.TP
.B \-skin <skin\ directory> (BETA CODE)
Load skin from the given directory (WITHOUT path name).

.I EXAMPLE:
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs "\-skin fittyfene"
tries Skin/fittyfene.
It first checks
/usr/local/share/mplayer/
and afterwards ~/.mplayer/.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-slave \ \ 
This option switches on slave mode.
This is intended for use of MPlayer as a backend to other programs.
Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer will read simplistic command
lines from its stdin.
The section
.B SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
explains the syntax.
.TP
.B \-softsleep
Uses high quality software timers.
As precise as the RTC without requiring special privileges.
Comes at the price of higher CPU consumption.
.TP
.B \-speed <0.01\-100>
Set playback speed rate.
.TP
.B \-sstep <sec>
Specifies seconds between displayed frames.
Useful for slideshows.
.TP
.B \-use-stdin


.SH "DEMUXER/STREAM OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-aid <id> (also see \-alang option)
Select audio channel [MPEG: 0\-31 AVI/\:OGM: 1\-99 ASF/\:RM: 0\-127
VOB(AC3): 128\-159 VOB(LPCM): 160\-191]
MPlayer prints the available IDs when running in verbose (-v) mode.
.TP
.B \-alang <two letter\ country\ code> (also see \-aid option)
Works only for DVD playback.
It selects the DVD audio language and always tries to play audio streams whose
language matches the given code.
For the list of available languages, use with the \-v switch and look at the
output.

.I EXAMPLE:
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs "\-alang hu,en"
Plays Hungarian and falls back to English if Hungarian is not available.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-audio\-demuxer <number> (\-audiofile only)
Force audio demuxer type for \-audiofile.
Give the demuxer ID as defined in demuxers.h.
Use \-audio\-demuxer 17 to force .mp3 detection.
.TP
.B \-audiofile <filename>
Play audio from an external file (WAV, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis).
.TP
.B \-cdrom\-device <path\ to\ device>
Override default CDROM drive name /dev/\:cdrom.
.TP
.B \-cache <kbytes>
This option specifies how much memory (in kbytes) to use when precaching a
file/\:URL.
Especially useful on slow media (default is \-nocache).
.TP
.B \-cdda <option1:option2>
This option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature of MPlayer.
.br
Available options are:
.
.RSs
.IPs speed=<value>
set CD spin speed
.IPs paranoia=<0\-2>
set paranoia level
.RSss
0: disable checking
.br
1: overlap checking only (default)
.br
2: full data correction and verification
.REss
.IPs generic-dev=<value>
use specified generic SCSI device
.IPs sector-size=<value>
atomic read size
.IPs overlap=<value>
force minimum overlap search during verification to <value> sectors.
.IPs toc-bias
Assume that the beginning offset of track 1 as reported in the TOC will be
addressed as LBA\ 0.
Some Toshiba drives need this for getting track boundaries correct.
.IPs toc-offset=<value>
Add <value> sectors to the values reported when addressing tracks.
May be negative.
.IPs (no)skip
(never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.
.RE
.
.TP
.B \-channels <number>
Change the number of playback channels, defaults to '2' if not specified.
If the number of output channels is bigger than the number of input channels
empty channels are inserted (unless mixing from mono to stereo, then the mono
channel is repeated in both output channels).
If the number of output channels is smaller than the number of input channels,
results depend on the audio decoder (\-afm).
Mplayer asks the decoder to decode the audio into as many channels as
specified. Now it's up to the decoder to fulfill the requirement. If the
decoder outputs more channels than requested, the exceeding channels are
truncated. This is usually only important when playing videos with AC3 audio
(like DVDs). In that case liba52 does the decoding by default and correctly
downmixes the audio into the requested number of channels.

.I NOTE:
.br
This option is honored by codecs (AC3 only) filters (surround) and ao drivers
(OSS at least).
.br
Available options are:

.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs 2

.TP
.B \-frames <number>
Play/\:convert only first <number> frames, then quit.
.TP
.B \-hr\-mp3\-seek (.MP3 only)
Hi\-res mp3 seeking.
Default is: enabled when playing from external MP3 file, as we need to seek
to the very exact position to keep A/\:V sync.It can be slow especially when
seeking backwards \- it has to rewind to the beginning to find the exact
frame.
.TP
.B \-idx (also see \-forceidx)

Activate a comma separated list of audio filters and their options.
.br
Available filters are:
.
.RSs
.IPs resample[=srate[:sloppy][:fast]]
Changes the sample rate of the audio stream to an integer srate (Hz).
It only supports the 16 bit little endian format.
.IPs channels[=nch]
Change the number of channels to nch output channels.
If the number of output channels is bigger than the number of input channels
empty channels are inserted (except mixing from mono to stereo, then the mono
channel is repeated in both of the output channels).
If the number of output channels is smaller than the number of input channels
the exceeding channels are truncated.
.IPs format[=bps,f]
Select the format f and bits per sample bps used for output from the
filter layer. The option bps is an integer and denotes bytes per
sample. The format f is a string containing a concatenated mix of:
.br
alaw, mulaw or imaadpcm
.br
float or int
.br
unsigned or signed
.br
le or be (little or big endian)
.br
.IPs "volume[=v:sc:pr:en]"
Select the output volume level.
This filter is not reentrant and can therefore only be enabled once for every
audio stream.
.RSss
v: desired gain in dB for all channels in the stream. The gain can be
set from -200dB to +40dB (where -200dB mutes the sound completely and
+40dB equals a gain of 1000). The default gain is -20dB.
.br
sc: enable soft clipping.
.br
pr: enable probing of the volume level for each audio stream. Both the
maximum and instantaneous volume is probed. The instantaneous volume
can only be accessed through the runtime interface, but the maximum
volume is printed at the end of the movie. This value can be used when
transcoding movies to maximize the utilization of the dynamic range.

Note: The lavc filter is now auto inserted if you try to play a non MPEG1/2
format so all formats supported by MPlayer should play out of the box (if
you have the CPU power needed to encode on the fly).
The overlay chipset used on the dxr2 is of pretty bad quality but the default
settings should work for everybody. The OSD may be usable with the
overlay (not on TV) by drawing it in the colorkey. With the default colorkey
settings you may get variable results, usually you will see the colorkey around
the characters or some other funny effect. Buf if you properly adjust the
colorkey settings you should be able to get acceptable results.

Specify a priority list of video drivers to be used, according to their driver
name in codecs.conf.
It falls back to default if none is ok.

.I NOTE:

If libdivxdecore support was compiled in, then odivx and divx4 now contains
just the same DivX4 codec, but different APIs to reach it.
For difference between them and when to use which, check the DivX4 section in

The parameters are optional and if omitted, some of them are set to default
values.
Use -1 to keep the default value.
Parameters w:h means width x height in pixels, x:y means x;y position counted
from the upper left corner of the bigger image.
.br
To get a full list of available plugins, see \-vop help.
.br
Available filters are:
.
.RSs
.IPs crop[=w:h:x:y]
Crops the given part of the image and discards the rest.
Useful to remove black bands from widescreen movies.
.IPs rectangle[=w:h:x:y]
Draws a rectangle of the requested width and height at the specified
coordinates over the image (used to test crop).
(default: maximum w/\:h, upper left x/\:y position)
.IPs expand[=w:h:x:y:o]
Expands (not scales) movie resolution to the given value and places the
unscaled original at coordinates x y.
Can be used for placing subtitles/\:OSD in the resulting black bands (default:
original w/\:h, centered x/\:y).
The last parameter (de)activates OSD rendering (default: 0).
.IPs flip
Flips the image upside down.
See also option \-flip.
.IPs mirror
Flips the image on Y axis.
.IPs rotate[=<0-7>]
Rotates and flips (optional) the image +/\:\- 90 degrees.
For parameters between 4-7 rotation is only done if the movie's geometry is
portrait and not landscape.
.IPs scale[=w:h[:c[:p]]]
Scales the image with the software scaler (slow) and performs a YUV<\->RGB
colorspace conversion (see \-sws option too).
The value 0 is used for scaled (aspect) destination w/\:h.
(default: original w/\:h, destination w/\:h with \-zoom) Optionaly chroma
skipping (c from 0\-3) and scaling parameters can be specified.
(see the \-sws option for details)

is poor quality or is not available.
.IPs dint[=sense:level]
Detects and drops first of interlaced frames in video stream.
Values can be from 0.0 to 1.0 - first (default 0.1) is relative difference
between neighbor pixels, second (default 0.15) is what part of image have to
be detected as interlaced to drop the frame.
.IPs "unsharp=l|cWxH:amount[:l|cWxH:amount]"
Unsharp mask / gaussian blur.
.RSss
l: apply effect on luma component
