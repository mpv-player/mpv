.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mplayer
Yes. Yet another movie player for linux.
What is the special with this? It works, at least for me :)
I've tried lots of players under linux (mtv,xmps,dvdview,livid/oms,VideoLAN,
xine,xanim,avifile,xmmp) but they all have some problem. Mostly with
special files or with audio/video sync. Most of them is unable to play
both mpeg1, mpeg2 and avi (DivX) files. Many players have image quality
or speed problems too. So I've decided to write/modify one...
.LP
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
MPlayer works out-of-the-box, so you generally don't have to mess with
any options.
.TP
.BI \-vo\ output\ driver
select output driver

you can get the list of available drivers executing
.I mplayer -vo help

.TP
.BI \-vcd\ track
play video cd track from device instead of plain file
.TP
.BI \-nosound
don't play sound
.TP
.B \-fs
fullscreen playing (only gl, xmga and xv drivers)

.I NOTE
The X11 driver doesn't support fullscreen and scaling.
However, you can do it yourself, just press ALT,CTRL,-
or ALT,CTRL,+ simultaneously, see X-server docs for details.
.TP
.B \-x\ x
scale image to x width [if driver suppports!]
.TP
.B \-y\ y
scale image to y height
.TP
.B \-xy\ factor
scale image by <factor>
.TP
.B \-dsp\ device
select another DSP output device
.TP
.B \-pp\ quality
apply postprocess filter on decoded image.
You need a STRONG CPU in order to use this!
The supported formats and settings are:

        MPEG 1/2   1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
        OpenDivX   1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
        DivX       not YET supported

.I NOTE
Maybe less/more.

.I NOTE
You can use this with OpenDivX encoding too! See ALPHA/BETA CODE section.
.IP
.SH KEYBOARD CONTROL
.TP
.I NOTE
These keys may/may not work, depending on your video output driver.
.TP
	  <-  or  ->      seek backward/forward  10 seconds

up or down      seek backward/forward   1 minute

p or SPACE      pause movie (press any key)

q or ESC        stop playing and quit program

+ or -          adjust audio delay by +/- 0.1 second
.IP
.SH "ADVANCED OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
These options can help you solve your particular problem.. Also, see the DOCS!
.TP
.B \-afm <1-5>
force audio format  1:MPEG 2:PCM 3:AC3 4:Win32 5:aLaw

.I NOTE
With DivX AVIs with MP3 audio, you can choose whether to use MP3LIB (option 1),
or Win32 DLL l3codeca.acm (option 4) (default). On CPUs with the 3DNow!
instruction set, the first gives more performance. Your mileage may vary.
.TP
.BI \-sb\ position
seek to byte position
.TP
.BI \-abs\ bytes
audio buffer size (in bytes, default: measuring)
.TP
.B \-delay\ secs
audio delay in seconds (may be +/- float value)
.TP
.B \-bps
use avg. byte/sec value for A-V sync (AVI)
.TP
.B \-noalsa
disable timing code
.TP
.B \-aid\ id
select audio channel [MPG: 0-31  AVI: 1-99]
.TP
.B \-vid\ id
select video channel [MPG: 0-15  AVI:  -- ]
.TP
.B \-fps\ value
force frame rate (if value is wrong in the header)
.TP
.B \-mc\ seconds/5frame
maximum sync correction per 5 frames (in seconds)
.TP
.B \-ni
force usage of non-interleaved AVI parser
.TP
.B \-include
specify config file to be parsed after the default
.IP
.SH "ALPHA/BETA CODE"
.TP
.I NOTE
These are included in this manpage just for completeness! If you don't
know what are these, you DON'T need these! In either case, double-check DOCS!
.TP
.B \-br\ rate
used with '-vo odivx' .
Specifies the bitrate to encode OpenDivx at
(in bits! e.g: 780000).
.TP
.B \-encode\ file
used with '-vo odivx' .
Specifies the output OpenDivX file. Won't overwrite.
.IP
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Just launch it! :)
