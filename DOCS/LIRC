o What is LIRC?

 Linux Infrared Remote Control - use an easy to build home-brewn IR-receiver, 
 an (almost) arbitrary remote control and control your linux box with it!
 More about it at www.lirc.org.

o MPlayer and LIRC

 If you have installed the lirc-package, you can compile MPlayer with LIRC
 support using  ./configure --enable-lirc
 You should do 'make distclean' before re-compile with 'make dep;make'

 If everything went fine, MPlayer will print a message like 
   LIRC init was successful.
 on startup. If an error occurs it will tell you. If it doens't tell you 
 anything about LIRC there's no support compiled in. That's it :-)

 The application name for MPlayer is - oh wonder - mplayer.
 It understands the following commands:

 PAUSE  - pause playing. Any other keystroke will continue replay.
 QUIT   - exit mplayer
 RWND   - 10 secs back
 FRWND  - 60 secs back
 FWD    - skip 10 secs
 FFWD   - skip 60 secs

 Don't forget to enable the repeat flag for RWND/FWD in .lircrc. Here's an
 excerpt from my .lircrc:

 begin
  remote = CU-SX070
  prog = mplayer
  button = Tape_Play
  repeat = 1
  config = FFWD
 end

 begin
  remote = CU-SX070
  prog = mplayer
  button = Tape_Stop
  config = QUIT
 end
	      
 Enjoy
