.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mplayer
is a movie player for Linux (runs on many other platforms and CPU
architectures, see the documentation).
It plays most MPEG/\:VOB, AVI, ASF/\:WMA/\:WMV, RM, QT/\:MOV/\:MP4, OGG/\:OGM,
MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM and RoQ files, supported by many
native and binary codecs.
You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX\ 3/\:4/\:5 and even WMV movies,
too.
.PP
MPlayer supports a wide range of video and audio output drivers.
It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, libcaca, DirectFB,
Quartz, but you can also use GGI, SDL (and all their drivers), VESA (on every
VESA-compatible card, even without X11), some low-level card-specific drivers
(for Matrox, 3Dfx and ATI) and some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the
Siemens DVB, DXR2 and DXR3/\:Hollywood+.
Most of them support software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in
fullscreen mode.
.PP
MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice big
antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls.
European/\:ISO 8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and Korean
fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, SubRip, OGM,
SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS and our own: MPsub) and
DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VOBsub and Closed Captions).
.PP
.B mencoder
(MPlayer's Movie Encoder) is a simple movie encoder, designed to encode
MPlayer-playable movies (see above) to other MPlayer-playable formats (see
below).
It encodes to DivX4, XviD, one of the libavcodec codecs and PCM/\:MP3/\:VBRMP3
audio in 1, 2 or 3\ passes.
Furthermore it has stream copying abilities, a powerful filter system (crop,
expand, flip, postprocess, rotate, scale, noise, rgb/\:yuv conversion) and
more.
.PP
.B gmplayer
is MPlayer with a graphical user interface.
It has the same options as MPlayer.
.PP
.B Also see the HTML documentation!

.SH "KEYBOARD CONTROL"
MPlayer has a fully configurable, command-driven control layer
which allows you to control MPlayer using keyboard, mouse, joystick
or remote control (with LIRC).
.br
The default configuration file for the input system is
~/.mplayer/\:input.conf but it can be overriden
using the \-input option.

.\" Options
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------
.
.SH "USAGE"
Every 'flag' option has a 'noflag' counterpart, e.g.\& the opposite of the
\-fs option is \-nofs.
.PP
If an option is marked as (XXX only), it will only work in combination with
the XXX option or if XXX is compiled in.
.PP
You can put all of the options in a configuration file which will be read
every time MPlayer is run.
The system-wide configuration file 'mplayer.conf' is in your configuration
directory (e.g.\& /etc/\:mplayer or /usr/\:local/\:etc/\:mplayer), the user
specific one is '~/\:.mplayer/\:config'.
User specific options override system-wide options and options given on the
command line override either.
The syntax of the configuration files is 'option=<value>', everything after
a '#' is considered a comment.
Options that work without values can be enabled by setting them to 'yes'
or '1' or 'true' and disabled by setting them to 'no' or '0' or 'false'.
Even suboptions can be specified in this way.
.PP
.I EXAMPLE:
.br
# Use Matrox driver by default.
.br
vo=xmga
.br
# I love practicing handstands while watching videos.
.br
flip=yes
.br
# Decode/\:encode multiple files from png,
.br
# start with mf://filemask
.br
mf=type=png:fps=25
.br
# Eerie negative images are cool.
.br
vf=eq2=1.0:-0.8
.PP
You can also write file-specific configuration files.
If you wish to have a configuration file for a file called 'movie.avi', create a file
named 'movie.avi.conf' with the file-specific options in it and put it in
~/.mplayer or in the same directory as the file.
.
.
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-codecs-file <filename>
Use the specified file instead of system wide installed or builtin codecs.conf.
See also \-afm, \-ac, \-vfm and \-vc.
.TP
.B \-include <configuration\ file>
Specify configuration file to be parsed after the default ones.
.TP
.B \-quiet \ \ 
Make console output less verbose; in particular, prevents the status line
(i.e.\& A:   0.7 V:   0.6 A-V:  0.068 ...) from being displayed.
Particularly useful on slow terminals or broken ones which do not properly
handle carriage return (i.e.\& \\r).
.TP
.B \-v, \-verbose
Increment verbose level (more \-v means more verbosity).
.
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs 0
only some informational output (default)
.IPs 1
some basic debug infos, avi header, function values (init debug)
.IPs 2
print avi indexes, chunk inputs, more debug infos (player debug)
.IPs 3
prints everything related to input parsers (parser debug)
.RE
.PD 1

.
.
.SH "PLAYER OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)"
.TP
.B \-autoq <quality> (use with \-vf [s]pp)
Dynamically changes the level of postprocessing depending on the available spare
CPU time.
The number you specify will be the maximum level used.
Usually you can use some big number.
You have to use \-vf [s]pp without parameters in order for this to work.
.TP
.B \-autosync <factor>
Gradually adjusts the A/\:V sync based on audio delay measurements.
Specifying \-autosync\ 0, the default, will cause frame timing to be based
entirely on audio delay measurements.
Specifying \-autosync\ 1 will do the same, but will subtly change the A/\:V
correction algorithm.
An uneven video framerate in a movie which plays fine with \-nosound can
often be helped by setting this to an integer value greater than 1.
The higher the value, the closer the timing will be to \-nosound.
Try \-autosync\ 30 to smooth out problems with sound drivers which do
not implement a perfect audio delay measurement.
With this value, if large A/\:V sync offsets occur, they will only take about
1 or 2\ seconds to settle out.
This delay in reaction time to sudden A/\:V offsets should be the only
side-effect of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.
.TP
.B \-benchmark
Prints some statistics on CPU usage and dropped frames at the end of playback.
Use in combination with \-nosound and \-vo null for benchmarking only the
video codec.
.br
.I NOTE:
With this option MPlayer will also ignore frame duration when playing
only video (you can think of that as infinite fps).
.TP
.B \-colorkey <number>
Changes the colorkey to an RGB value of your choice.
0x000000 is black and 0xffffff is white.
Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev, svga, vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix and
xover video out drivers.
.TP
.B \-nocolorkey
Disables colorkeying.
Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev, svga, vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix and
xover video out drivers.
.TP
.B \-edl <filename> (EDL only)
Enables edit decision list (EDL) actions during playback.
Video will be skipped over and audio will be muted and unmuted according to
the entries in the given file.
See DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details on how to use this.
.TP
.B \-edlout <filename> (EDL only)
Creates a new file and writes edit decision list (EDL) records to that file.
During playback, when the user hits 'i', an entry to skip over the last two
seconds of playback will be written to the file.
This provides a starting point from which the user can fine-tune EDL entries
later.
See DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details.
.TP
.B \-enqueue (GUI only)
Enqueue files given on the command line in the playlist instead of playing them
immediately.
.TP
.B \-fixed-vo (BETA CODE!)
Enforces a fixed video system for multiple files (one (un)initialisation for
all files).
Therefore only one window will be opened for all files.
Currently the following drivers are fixed-vo compliant: gl2, mga, svga, x11,
xmga, xv, xvidix and dfbmga.
.TP
.B \-framedrop (also see \-hardframedrop)
Skip displaying some frames to maintain A/\:V sync on slow systems.
Video filters are not applied to such frames.
For B frames even decoding is skipped completely.
.TP
.B \-h, \-help, \-\-help
Show short summary of options.
.TP
.B \-hardframedrop
More intense frame dropping (breaks decoding).
Leads to image distortion!
.TP
.B \-identify
Show file parameters in an easily parseable format.
The wrapper script TOOLS/midentify suppresses the other MPlayer output and
(hopefully) shellescapes the filenames.
.TP
.B \-input <commands>
This option can be used to configure certain parts of the input system.
Paths are relative to ~/\:.mplayer/.
.br
.I NOTE:
Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.
.sp 1
Available commands are:
.sp 1
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs conf=<file>
Read alternative input.conf.
If no full path is given, ~/\:.mplayer/<file> is assumed.
.IPs ar-delay
Delay in msec before we start to autorepeat a key (0 to disable).
.IPs ar-rate
Number of key presses to generate per second on autorepeat.
.IPs keylist
Prints all keys that can be bound to commands.
.IPs cmdlist
Prints all commands that can be bound to keys.
.IPs js-dev
Specifies the joystick device to use (default is /dev/\:input/\:js0).
.IPs file\ 
Read commands from the given file.
Mostly useful with a fifo.
.br
.I NOTE:
When the given file is a fifo MPlayer opens both ends so you can do
several 'echo "seek 10" > mp_pipe' and the pipe will stay valid.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-lircconf <file> (LIRC only)
Specifies a configuration file for LIRC (default: ~/\:.lircrc).
.TP
.B \-list-options
Prints out all the available options.
.TP
.B \-loop <number>
Loops movie playback <number> times.
0 means forever.
.TP
.B \-menu (OSD menu only)
Turn on OSD menu support.
.TP
.B \-menu-cfg <file> (OSD menu only)
Use an alternative menu.conf.
.TP
.B \-menu-root <value> (OSD menu only)
Specify the main menu.
.TP
.B \-noconsolecontrols
Prevent MPlayer from reading key events from standard input.
Useful when reading data from standard input.
This is automatically enabled when \- is found on the command line.
There are situations where you have to set it manually, e.g.\&
if you open /dev/stdin (or the equivalent on your system), use stdin
in a playlist or intend to read from stdin later on via the loadfile or
loadlist slave commands.
.TP
.B \-nojoystick
Turns off joystick support.
.TP
.B \-nolirc
Turns off LIRC support.
.TP
.B \-nomouseinput (X11 only)
Disable mouse button press/release input (mozplayerxp's context menu relies
on this option).
.TP
.B \-nortc (RTC only)
Turns off usage of the Linux RTC (realtime clock \- /dev/\:rtc) as timing
mechanism.
.TP
.B \-playlist <file>
Play files according to a playlist file (ASX, Winamp, SMIL, or
one-file-per-line format).
.br
.I NOTE:
This option is considered an entry so options found after it will apply
only to the elements of this playlist.
.br
FIXME: This needs to be clarified and documented thoroughly.
.TP
.B \-really-quiet (also see \-quiet)
Display even less output and status messages than with \-quiet.
.TP
.B \-rtc-device <device>
Use the specified device for RTC timing.
.TP
.B \-shuffle
Play files in random order.
.TP
.B \-skin <name> (GUI only)
Loads a skin from the directory given as parameter below the default skin
directories, /usr/local/share/mplayer/Skin/ and ~/.mplayer/Skin/.
.sp 1
.I EXAMPLE:
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs "\-skin fittyfene"
Tries /usr/local/share/mplayer/Skin/fittyfene
and afterwards ~/.mplayer/Skin/fittyfene.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-slave (also see \-input)
Switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend for other programs.
Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer will read commands from stdin.
See DOCS/tech/slave.txt and \-input cmdlist for a list of slave commands.
.TP
.B \-softsleep
Use high-quality software timers instead of the RTC.
As precise as the RTC without requiring special privileges.
Comes at the price of higher CPU consumption.
.TP
.B \-speed <0.01\-100>
Slow down or speed up playback by the factor given as parameter.
.TP
.B \-sstep <sec>
Display one frame every <sec> seconds.
Useful for slideshows.
.
.
.SH "DEMUXER/STREAM OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-a52drc <level>
Select the Dynamic Range Compression level for AC3 audio streams.
<level> is a float value ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 means no compression
and 1 (which is the default) means full compression (make loud passages more
silent and vice versa).
This option only shows an effect if the AC3 stream contains the required range
compression information.
.TP
.B \-aid <id> (also see \-alang)
Select audio channel (MPEG: 0\-31, AVI/\:OGM: 1\-99, ASF/\:RM: 0\-127,
VOB(AC3): 128\-159, VOB(LPCM): 160\-191, MPEG-TS 17\-8190).
MPlayer prints the available IDs when run in verbose (\-v) mode.
When playing an MPEG-TS stream, MPlayer/MEncoder will use the first program
(if present) with the chosen audio stream.
.TP
.B \-alang <two letter\ country\ code> (also see \-aid) (DVD only)
Selects the DVD audio language and tries to play audio streams whose
language matches the given code.
MPlayer prints a list of available languages when run in verbose (\-v) mode.
.sp 1
.I EXAMPLE:
.PD 0

.B \-audio-demuxer <number> (\-audiofile only)
Force audio demuxer type for \-audiofile.
Give the demuxer ID as defined in libmpdemux/demuxer.h.
\-audio-demuxer 17 forces MP3.
.TP
.B \-audiofile <filename>
Play audio from an external file (WAV, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis) while viewing a
movie.
.TP
.B \-audiofile-cache <kBytes>
Enables caching for the stream used by \-audiofile, using the specified
amount of memory.
.TP
.B \-bandwidth <value> (network only)
Specify the maximum bandwidth for network streaming (for servers that are
able to send content in different bitrates).
Useful if you want to watch live streamed media behind a slow connection.
.TP
.B \-cdrom-device <path\ to\ device>
Specify the CD-ROM device (default: /dev/\:cdrom).
.TP
.B \-cache <kBytes>
This option specifies how much memory (in kBytes) to use when precaching a
file or URL.
Especially useful on slow media.
.TP
.B \-cache-min <percentage>
Playback will start when the cache fill threshold set with this option
is reached.
.TP
.B \-cache-prefill <percentage> (not yet implemented)
When the cache is emptied MPlayer will pause and restart playback when
the cache prefill threshold set with this option is reached.
.TP
.B \-cdda <option1:option2> (CDDA only)
This option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature of MPlayer.
.sp 1
Available options are:
.
.RSs
.IPs speed=<value>
Set CD spin speed.
.IPs paranoia=<0\-2>
Set paranoia level.
.RSss
0: disable checking
.br
1: overlap checking only (default)
.br
2: full data correction and verification
.REss
.IPs generic-dev=<value>
Use specified generic SCSI device.
.IPs sector-size=<value>
Set atomic read size.
.IPs overlap=<value>
Force minimum overlap search during verification to <value> sectors.
.IPs toc-bias
Assume that the beginning offset of track 1 as reported in the TOC will be
addressed as LBA\ 0.
Some Toshiba drives need this for getting track boundaries correct.
.IPs toc-offset=<value>
Add <value> sectors to the values reported when addressing tracks.
May be negative.
.IPs (no)skip
(Never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.
.RE
.
.TP
.B \-channels <number>
Change the number of playback channels (default: 2).
If the number of output channels is bigger than the number of input channels
empty channels are inserted (unless mixing from mono to stereo, then the mono
channel is repeated in both output channels).
If the number of output channels is smaller than the number of input channels,
results depend on the audio decoder (\-afm).
MPlayer asks the decoder to decode the audio into as many channels as
specified.
Now it's up to the decoder to fulfill the requirement.
If the decoder outputs more channels than requested, the exceeding channels
are truncated.
This is usually only important when playing videos with AC3 audio (like DVDs).
In that case liba52 does the decoding by default and correctly downmixes the
audio into the requested number of channels.
.br
.I NOTE:
This option is honored by codecs (AC3 only), filters (surround) and ao drivers
(OSS at least).

Send cookies when making HTTP requests.
.TP
.B \-cookies-file <filename> (network only)
Read HTTP cookies from specified file (default: ~/.mozilla/ and ~/.netscape/)
and skip reading from default locations.
The file is assumed to be in Netscape format.
.TP
.B \-demuxer <number>
Force demuxer type.
Give the demuxer ID as defined in libmpdemux/demuxer.h.
\-demuxer 17 forces MP3.
.TP
.B \-dumpaudio (MPlayer only)
Dumps raw compressed audio stream to ./stream.dump (useful with MPEG/\:AC3).
.TP
.B \-dumpfile <filename> (MPlayer only)
Specify which file MPlayer should dump to.
Should be used together with \-dumpaudio / \-dumpvideo / \-dumpstream.
.TP
.B \-dumpstream (MPlayer only)
Dumps the raw stream to ./stream.dump.
Useful when ripping from DVD or network.

.TP
.B \-dvdangle <angle\ id> (DVD only)
Some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple angles.
Here you can tell MPlayer which angles to use (default: 1).
.TP
.B \-forceidx
Force index rebuilding.
Useful for files with broken index (A/V desync, etc).
This will enable seeking in files where seeking was not possible.
You can fix the index permanently with MEncoder (see the documentation).
.br
.I NOTE:
This option only works if the underlying media supports seeking
(i.e.\& not with stdin, pipe, etc).
.TP
.B \-fps <float value>
Override video framerate.
Useful if the original value is wrong or missing.
.TP
.B \-frames <number>
Play/\:convert only first <number> frames, then quit.
.TP
.B \-hr-mp3-seek (MP3 only)
Hi-res MP3 seeking.
Enabled when playing from an external MP3 file, as we need to seek
to the very exact position to keep A/\:V sync.
Can be slow especially when seeking backwards since it has to rewind
to the beginning to find an exact frame position.
.TP

.RSs
.IPs resample[=srate[:sloppy][:type]]
Changes the sample rate of the audio stream to an integer srate (Hz).
It only supports the 16 bit little endian format.
.IPs channels[=nch]
Change the number of channels to nch output channels.
If the number of output channels is bigger than the number of input channels
empty channels are inserted (except mixing from mono to stereo, then the mono
channel is repeated in both of the output channels).
If the number of output channels is smaller than the number of input channels
the exceeding channels are truncated.
.IPs format[=bps:f]
Select the format f and bytes per sample bps used for output from the
filter layer.
The option bps is an integer and denotes Bytes per sample.
The format f is a string containing a concatenated mix of:

alaw, mulaw or imaadpcm
.br
float or int
.br
unsigned or signed
.br
le or be (little or big endian)

This filter is not reentrant and can therefore only be enabled once for every
audio stream.
.RSss
v: desired gain in dB for all channels in the stream.
The gain can be set from -200dB to +60dB (where -200dB mutes the sound
completely and +60dB equals a gain of 1000).

with lower bitrates.
Initial values in the range -100\-100 may be given on the command line.
.TP
.B eq2[=gamma:contrast:brightness:saturation:rg:gg:bg:weight]
Alternative software equalizer that uses lookup tables (very slow),
allowing gamma correction in addition to simple brightness
and contrast adjustment.
Note that it uses the same MMX optimized code as \-vf eq if all
gamma values are 1.0.
The parameters are given as floating point values.
Parameters rg, gg, bg are the independent gamma values for the Red, Green
and Blue components.
The weight parameter can be used to reduce the effect of a high gamma value on
bright image areas, e.g.\& keep them from getting overamplified and just plain
white.
A value of 0.0 turns the gamma correction all the way down while 1.0 leaves it
at its full strength.
Defaults are gamma=1.0, contrast=1.0, brightness=0.0, saturation=1.0,
weight=1.0.
Value ranges are 0.1\-10 for gamma, -2\-2 for contrast (negative values result
in a negative image), -1\-1 for brightness, 0\-3 for saturation and 0\-1 for
weight.
.TP

.B halfpack[=f]
Convert planar YUV 4:2:0 to half-height packed 4:2:2, downsampling luma but
keeping all chroma samples.
Useful for output to low-resolution display devices when hardware downscaling
is poor quality or is not available.
Can also be used as a primitive luma-only deinterlacer with very low cpu
usage.
By default, halfpack averages pairs of lines when downsampling.
The optional parameter f can be 0 to only use even lines, or 1 to only use
odd lines.
Any other value for f gives the default (averaging) behavior.
.TP
.B ilpack[=mode]
When interlaced video is stored in YUV 4:2:0 formats, chroma
interlacing does not line up properly due to vertical downsampling of
the chroma channels.
This filter packs the planar 4:2:0 data into YUY2 (4:2:2) format with
the chroma lines in their proper locations, so that in any given
scanline, the luma and chroma data both come from the same field.
The optional argument selects the sampling mode.
By default, linear interpolation (mode 1) is used.
Mode 0 uses nearest-neighbor sampling, which is fast but incorrect.
.TP
.B harddup
Only useful with MEncoder.
If harddup is used when encoding, it will force duplicate frames to be
encoded in the output.
This uses slightly more space, but is necessary for output to MPEG
files or if you plan to demux and remux the video stream after
encoding.
Should be placed at or near the end of the filter chain unless you
have a good reason to do otherwise.
.TP
.B softskip
Only useful with MEncoder.
Softskip moves the frame skipping (dropping) step of encoding from
before the filter chain to some point during the filter chain.
This allows filters which need to see all frames (inverse telecine,
temporal denoising, etc.) to function properly.
Should be placed after the filters which need to see all frames and
before any subsequent filters that are CPU-intensive.
.TP
.B decimate[=max:hi:lo:frac]
Drops frames that don't differ greatly from the previous frame in
order to reduce framerate.
The argument max (if positive) sets the maximum number of consecutive
frames which can be dropped, or (if negative) the minimum interval
between dropped frames.
A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 region differs by more
than a threshold of hi, and if not more than frac portion (1 meaning
the whole image) differs by more than a threshold of lo.
Values of hi and lo are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actual
pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64 corresponds to 1 unit of
difference for each pixel, or the same spread out differently over the
block.
The main use of this filter is for very-low-bitrate encoding (e.g.\&
streaming over dialup modem), but it could in theory be used for
fixing movies that were inverse-telecined incorrectly.
.TP
.B dint[=sense:level]

The goal of this filter is to add the ability to process interlaced images
pre-field without deinterlacing them.
You can filter your interlaced DVD and play it on a TV without breaking the
interlacing.
While deinterlacing (with the postprocessing filter) removes interlacing
permanently (by smoothing, averaging, etc) deinterleaving splits the frame into
2 fields (so called half pictures), so you can process (filter) them
independently and then re-interleave them.

.B detc[=var1=value2:var2=value2:...]
Attempts to reverse the 'telecine' process to recover a clean,
non-interlaced stream at film framerate.
This was the first and most primitive inverse telecine filter to be
added to MPlayer/MEncoder.
It works by latching onto the telecine 3:2 pattern and following it as
long as possible.
This makes it suitable for perfectly-telecined material, even in the
presence of a fair degree of noise, but it will fail in the presence
of complex post-telecine edits.
Development on this filter is no longer taking place, as ivtc, pullup,
and filmdint are better for most applications.
The following arguments (see syntax above) may be used to control
detc's behavior:
.RSs
.IPs dr
Set the frame dropping mode.
0 (default) means don't drop frames to maintain fixed output framerate.
1 means always drop a frame when there have been no drops or telecine
merges in the past 5 frames.
2 means always maintain exact 5:4 input to output frame ratio.
.I NOTE:
Use mode 1 or 2 with MEncoder.
.IPs am
Analysis mode.
Available values are 0 (fixed pattern with initial frame number
specified by fr=#) and 1 (agressive search for telecine pattern).
Default is 1.
.IPs fr
Set initial frame number in sequence.
0\-2 are the three clean progressive frames; 3 and 4 are the two
interlaced frames.
The default, -1, means 'not in telecine sequence'.
The number specified here is the type for the imaginary previous
frame before the movie starts.
.IPs "tr0, tr1, tr2, tr3"
Threshold values to be used in certain modes.
.RE
.TP
.B ivtc[=1]
Experimental 'stateless' inverse telecine filter.
Rather than trying to lock on to a pattern like the detc filter does,
ivtc makes its decisions independently for each frame.
This will give much better results for material that has undergone
heavy editing after telecine was applied, but as a result it is not as
forgiving of noisy input, for example TV capture.
The optional parameter (ivtc=1) corresponds to the dr=1 option for the
detc filter, and should be used with MEncoder but not with MPlayer.
As with detc, you must specify the correct output framerate (\-ofps
23.976) when using MEncoder.
Further development on ivtc has stopped, as the pullup and filmdint
filters appear to be much more accurate.
.TP
.B pullup[=jl:jr:jt:jb:sb]\ 
Third-generation pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter,
capable of handling mixed hard-telecine, 24 fps progressive, and 30
fps progressive content.
The pullup filter is designed to be much more robust than detc or
ivtc, by taking advantage of future context in making its decisions.
Like ivtc, pullup is stateless in the sense that it does not lock onto
a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.
It is still under development, but believed to be quite accurate.
The jl, jr, jt, and jb options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at
the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively.
Left/right are in units of 8 pixels, while top/bottom are in units of
2 lines.
The default is 8 pixels on each side.
Setting the sb (strict breaks) option to 1 will reduce the chances of
pullup generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also
cause an excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion
sequences.
.I NOTE:
Always follow pullup with the softskip filter when encoding to ensure
that pullup is able to see each frame.
Failure to do so will lead to incorrect output and will usually crash,
due to design limitations in the codec/filter layer.
.TP
.B filmdint[=options]
Inverse telecine filter, similar to the pullup filter above.
It is designed to handle any pulldown pattern, including mixed soft and
hard telecine and limited support for movies that are slowed down or sped
up from their original framerate for TV.
Only the luma plane is used to find the frame breaks.
If a field has no match, it is deinterlaced with simple linear
approximation.
If the source is MPEG-2, and this must be the first filter to allow
access to the field-flags set by the MPEG-2 decoder.
Depending on the source MPEG, you may be fine ignoring this advice, as
long as you do not see lots of "Bottom-first field" warnings.
With no options it does normal inverse telecine, and should be used
together with mencoder \-fps 29.97 \-ofps 23.976.
When this filter is used with mplayer, it will result in an uneven
framerate during playback, but it is still generally better than using
pp=lb or no deinterlacing at all.
Multiple options can be specified separated by /.
.RSs
.IPs crop=w:h:x:y
Just like the crop filter, but faster, and works on mixed hard and soft
telecined content as well as when y is not a multiple of 4.
If x or y would require cropping fractional pixels from the chroma
planes, the crop area is extended.
This usually means that x and y must be even.
.IPs io=ifps:ofps
For each ifps input frames the filter will output ofps frames.
The ratio of ifps/ofps should match the \-fps/\-ofps ratio.
This could be used to filter movies that are broadcast on TV at a frame
rate different from their original framerate.
.IPs luma_only=n
If n is nonzero, the chroma plane is copied unchanged.
This is useful for YV12 sampled TV, which discards one of the chroma
fields.
.IPs mmx2=n
On x86, if n=1, use MMX2 optimized functions, if n=2, use 3DNow!
optimized functions, othewise, use plain C.
If this option is not specified, MMX2 and 3DNow! are auto-detected, use
this option to override auto-detection.
.IPs fast=n
The larger n will speed up the filter at the expense of accuracy.
The default value is n=3.
If n is odd, a frame immediately following a frame marked with the
REPEAT_FIRST_FIELD MPEG flag is assumed to be progressive, thus filter
will not spend any time on soft-telecined MPEG-2 content.
This is the only effect of this flag if MMX2 or 3DNow! is available.
Without MMX2 and 3DNow, if n=0 or 1, the same calculations will be used
as with n=2 or 3.
If n=2 or 3, the number of luma levels used to find the frame breaks is
reduced from 256 to 128, which results in a faster filter without losing
much accuracy.
If n=4 or 5, a faster, but much less accurate metric will be used to
find the frame breaks, which is more likely to misdetect high vertical
detail as interlaced content.
.IPs verbose=n
If n is nonzero, print the detailed metrics for each frame.
Useful for debugging.
.IPs dint_thres=n
Deinterlace threshold.
Used during de-interlacing of unmatched frames.
Larger value means less deinterlacing, use n=256 to completely turn off
deinterlacing.
Default is n=8.
.IPs comb_thres=n
Threshold for comparing a top and bottom fields.
Defaults to 128.
.IPs diff_thres=n
Threshold to detect temporal change of a field.
Default is 128.
.IPs sad_thres=n
Sum of Absolute Difference threshold, default is 64.
.RE
.TP
.B softpulldown
This filter works only correct with MEncoder and acts on the MPEG2 flags
used for soft 3:2 pulldown (soft telecine).
If you want to use the ivtc or detc filter on movies that are partly soft
telecined, inserting this filter before them should make them more reliable.
.TP
.B divtc[=options]
Inverse telecine for deinterlaced video.
If 3:2-pulldown telecined video has lost one of the fields or is deinterlaced
using a method that keeps one field and interpolates the other, the result is
a juddering video that has every fourth frame duplicated.
This filter is intended to find and drop those duplicates and restore the
original film framerate.
When using this filter, you must specify \-ofps that is 4/5 of the fps of the
input file (23.976 if the input is 29.97fps).
The options are:
.RSs
.IPs pass=1|2
Use two-pass mode.
This produces best results.
Pass 1 analyzes the video and writes the results to a log file.
Pass 2 then reads this log file and uses the information to do the actual work.
Note that these passes do NOT correspond to pass 1 and 2 of the encoding
process.
In order to use divtc two-pass with two-pass video encoding, you must perform
three passes: first divtc pass 1 and encoder pass 1, then divtc pass 2 and
encoder pass 1, and finally divtc pass 2 and encoder pass 2.
.IPs file=filename
Set the 2-pass log file name (default: "framediff.log").
.IPs threshold=value
Set the minimum strength the telecine pattern must have for the filter to
believe in it (default: 0.5).
This is used to avoid recognizing false pattern from the parts of the video
that are very dark or very still.
.IPs window=numframes
Set the number of past frames to look at when searching for pattern
(default: 30).
Longer window improves the reliability of the pattern search, but shorter
window improves the reaction time to the changes in the telecine phase.
This only affects the one-pass mode.
The two-pass mode currently uses fixed window that extends to both future
and past.
.IPs phase=0|1|2|3|4
Sets the initial telecine phase for one-pass mode (default: 0).
The two-pass mode can see the future, so it is able to use the correct
phase from the beginning, but one-pass mode can only guess.
It catches the correct phase when it finds it, but this option can be used
to fix the possible juddering at the beginning.
The first pass of the two-pass mode also uses this, so if you save the output
from the first pass, you get constant phase result.
.IPs deghost=value
Set the deghosting threshold (0\-255 for one-pass mode, -255\-255 for two-pass
mode, default 0).
If nonzero, deghosting mode is used.
This is for video that has been deinterlaced by blending the fields
together instead of dropping one of the fields.
Deghosting amplifies any compression artifacts in the blended frames, so the
parameter value is used as a threshold to exclude those pixels from
deghosting that differ from the previous frame less than specified value.
If two-pass mode is used, then negative value can be used to make the
filter analyze the whole video in the beginning of pass-2 to determine
whether it needs deghosting or not and then select either zero or the
absolute value of the parameter.
Specify this option for pass-2, it makes no difference on pass-1.

When a keyframe is found, an 'I!' string followed by a newline character is
printed, leaving the current line of mplayer/mencoder output on the screen,
because it contains the time (in seconds) and frame number of the keyframe
(You can use this information to split the AVI.).
.sp 1
If you call the filter with a numeric parameter 'step' then only one in
every 'step' frames is rendered.
.sp 1
If you put an 'i' (lowercase) before the number then an I! is printed
(like the I parameter).
.sp 1
If you give only the i then nothing is done to the frames, only I! is
printed.

.B tile=xtile:ytile:output:start:delta
Tile a series of images into a single, bigger image.
If you omit a parameter or use a value less than 0, then the default

MV & DC are most important, loosing them looks far worse than loosing
the AC and the 1. & 2. partition.
(MV&DC) are far smaller than the 3. partition (AC) meaning that errors

Thus, the picture will look better with partitioning than without,

MPEG4 uses a half pixel precision for its motion search by default.
The standard proposes a mode where encoders are allowed to use quarter

This option usually results in a sharper image.

quality at fixed bitrate) at a lesser cost than with VHQ.
