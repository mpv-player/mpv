.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mplayer
is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices and non\-x86 CPUs, see
the documentation).
It plays most MPEG/\:VOB, AVI, ASF/\:WMA/\:WMV, RM, QT/\:MOV/\:MP4, OGG/\:OGM,
VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM and RoQ files, supported by many
native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs.
You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX\ 3/\:4/\:5 and even WMV movies,
too (without using the avifile library).
.PP
Another great feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output
drivers.
It works with X11, XV, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB, but you
can also use GGI, SDL (and this way all their drivers), VESA (on every VESA
compatible card, even without X11), some low level card-specific drivers (for
Matrox, 3Dfx and ATI) and some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the
Siemens DVB, DXR2 and DXR3/\:Hollywood+.
Most of them support software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in
fullscreen.
.PP
MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice big
antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls.
European/\:ISO 8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and Korean
fonts are supported along with 11 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, SubRip,
SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS and our own: MPsub) and
DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VobSub and Closed Captions).
.PP
.B mencoder
(MPlayer's Movie Encoder) is a simple movie encoder, designed to encode
MPlayer-playable movies (see above) to other MPlayer-playable formats (see
below).
It encodes to DivX4, XviD, one of the libavcodec codecs and PCM/\:MP3/\:VBRMP3
audio in 1, 2 or 3\ passes.
Furthermore it has stream copying abilities, a powerful plugin system (crop,
expand, flip, postprocess, rotate, scale, noise, rgb/\:yuv conversion) and
more.
.PP
.B gmplayer
is MPlayer with a graphical user interface.
It has the same options as MPlayer.

.SH "KEYBOARD CONTROL"
MPlayer has a fully configurable, command driven, control layer
which allow you to control MPlayer using keyboard, mouse, joystick
or remote control (using lirc).
.br
The default configuration file for the input system is
~/.mplayer/\:input.conf but it can be overriden
using the \-input conf option.
.br
These keys may/\:may not work, depending on your video output driver.

.\" Options
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------
.
.SH "USAGE"
Every 'flag' option has a 'noflag' counterpart, e.g.\& the opposite of the
\-fs option is \-nofs.
.PP
You can put all of the options in a configuration file which will be read
every time MPlayer is run.
The system-wide configuration file 'mplayer.conf' is in your configuration
directory (e.g.\& /etc/\:mplayer or /usr/\:local/\:etc/\:mplayer), the user
specific one is '~/\:.mplayer/\:config'.
User specific options override system-wide options and options given on the
command line override either.
The syntax of the configuration files is 'option=<value>', everything after
a '#' is considered a comment.
Options that work without values can be enabled by setting them to 'yes'
or '1' and disabled by setting them to 'no' or '0'.
Even suboptions can be specified in this way.
.PP
.I EXAMPLE:
.br
# Use Matrox driver by default.
.br
vo=xmga
.br
# I love practicing handstands while watching videos.
.br
flip=yes
.br
# Decode/\:encode multiple files from png,
.br
# start with mf://filemask
.br
mf=type=png:fps=25
.br
# Eerie negative images are cool.
.br
vf=eq2=1.0:-0.8
.PP
You can also write file-specific configuration files.
If you wish to have a configuration file for a file called 'movie.avi', create a file
named 'movie.avi.conf' with the file-specific options in it and put it in
~/.mplayer or in the same directory as the file.
.
.
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-codecs-file <filename>
Use the specified file instead of system wide installed or builtin codecs.conf.
See also \-afm, \-ac, \-vfm and \-vc.
.TP
.B \-include <configuration\ file>
Specify configuration file to be parsed after the default ones.
.TP
.B \-quiet \ \ 
With this option the status line (i.e. A:   0.7 V:   0.6 A-V:  0.068 ...)
will not be displayed.
Particularly useful on slow terminals or broken ones that do not properly
handle carriage return (i.e. \\r).
.TP
.B \-v, \-verbose
Increment verbose level (more \-v means more verbosity).
.
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs 0
only some informational output (default)
.IPs 1
some basic debug infos, avi header, function values (init debug)
.IPs 2
print avi indexes, chunk inputs, more debug infos (player debug)
.IPs 3
prints everything related to input parsers (parser debug)
.RE
.PD 1
.
.
.
.SH "PLAYER OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)"
.TP
.B \-autoq <quality> (use with \-vf [s]pp)
Dynamically changes the level of postprocessing depending on available spare
CPU time.
The number you specify will be the maximum level used.
Usually you can use some big number.
You have to use \-vf [s]pp without parameters in order to use this.
.TP
.B \-autosync <factor>
Gradually adjusts the A/\:V sync based on audio delay measurements.
Specifying \-autosync\ 0, the default, will cause frame timing to be based
entirely on audio delay measurements.
Specifying \-autosync\ 1 will do the same, but will subtly change the A/\:V
correction algorithm used.
An uneven video frame rate in a movie which plays fine with \-nosound can
often be helped by setting this to an integer value greater than 1.
The higher the value, the closer the timing will be to \-nosound.
Try \-autosync\ 30 to smooth out problems with sound drivers which do
not implement a perfect audio delay measurement.
With this value, if large A/\:V sync offsets occur, they will only take about
1 or 2\ seconds to settle out.
This delay in reaction time to sudden A/\:V offsets should be the only
side-effect of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.
.TP
.B \-benchmark
Prints some statistics on CPU usage and dropped frames at the end.
Use in combination with \-nosound and \-vo null for benchmarking only the
video codec.
.br
.I NOTE:
With this option MPlayer will also ignore frame duration when playing
only video (you can think of that as infinite fps).
.TP
.B \-colorkey <number>
Changes the colorkey to an RGB value of your choice.
0x000000 is black and 0xffffff is white.
Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev, svga, vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix and
xover video out drivers.
.TP
.B \-nocolorkey
Disables colorkeying.
Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev, svga, vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix and
xover video out drivers.
.TP
.B \-edl <filename>
Enables edit decision list (EDL) actions during playback.
Video will be skipped over and audio will be muted and unmuted according to
the entries in the given file.
See DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details on how to use this.
.TP
.B \-edlout <filename>
Creates a new file and writes edit decision list (EDL) records to that file.
During playback, when the user hits 'i', an entry to skip over the last two
seconds of playback will be written to the file.
This provides a starting point from which the user can fine-tune EDL entries
later.
See DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details.
.TP
.B \-enqueue (GUI only)
Enqueue files given on the command line in the playlist instead of playing them
immediately.
.TP
.B \-fixed-vo (BETA CODE!)
Enforces a fixed video system for multiple files (one (un)initialisation for
all files).
Therefore only one window will be opened for all files.
Currently the following drivers are fixed-vo compliant: gl2, mga, svga, x11,
xmga, xv and xvidix.
.TP
.B \-framedrop (also see \-hardframedrop)
Skip displaying some frames to maintain A/\:V sync on slow systems.
Video filters are not applied to such frames.
For B frames even decoding is skipped completely.
.TP
.B \-h, \-help, \-\-help
Show short summary of options.
.TP
.B \-hardframedrop
More intense frame dropping (breaks decoding).
Leads to image distortion!
.TP
.B \-identify
Show file parameters in easy parsable format.
The wrapper script TOOLS/midentify suppresses the other MPlayer output and
(hopefully) shellescapes the filenames.
.TP
.B \-input <commands>
This option can be used to configure certain parts of the input system.
Paths are relative to ~/\:.mplayer/.
.br
.I NOTE:
Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.

Available commands are:

.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs conf=<file>
Read alternative input.conf.
If given without pathname, ~/\:.mplayer is assumed.
.IPs ar-delay
Delay in msec before we start to autorepeat a key (0 to disable).
.IPs ar-rate
How many key presses per second when we autorepeat.
.IPs keylist
Prints all keys that can be bound.
.IPs cmdlist
Prints all commands that can be bound.
.IPs js-dev
Specifies the joystick device to use (default is /dev/\:input/\:js0).
.IPs file\ 
Read commands from the given file.
Mostly useful with a fifo.
.br
.I NOTE:
When the given file is a fifo MPlayer opens both ends so you can do
several 'echo "seek 10" > mp_pipe' and the pipe will stay valid.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-lircconf <file>
Specifies a configuration file for LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control, see
http://www.lirc.org) if you don't like the default ~/\:.lircrc.
.TP
.B \-list-options
Prints out all the available options.
.TP
.B \-loop <number>
Loops movie playback <number> times.
0 means forever.
.TP
.B \-menu (BETA CODE)
Turn on OSD menu support.
.TP
.B \-menu-cfg <file> (BETA CODE)
Use an alternative menu.conf.
.TP
.B \-menu-root <value> (BETA CODE)
Specify the main menu.
.TP
.B \-nojoystick
Turns off joystick support.
Default is on, if compiled in.
.TP
.B \-nolirc
Turns off LIRC support.
.TP
.B \-nomouseinput
Disable mouse button press/release input (mozplayerxp's context menu relies
on this option).
.TP
.B \-nortc \ \ 
Turns off usage of the Linux RTC (real-time clock \- /dev/\:rtc) as timing
mechanism.
.TP
.B \-playlist <file>
Play files according to a playlist (1 file per row or Winamp or ASX format).
.br
.I NOTE:
This option is considered an entry so options found after it will apply
only to the elements of this playlist.
.TP
.B \-really-quiet
Display even less output and status messages.
.TP
.B \-shuffle
Play files in random order.
.TP
.B \-skin <skin\ directory> (GUI only)
Load skin from the given directory (WITHOUT path name).

.I EXAMPLE:
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs "\-skin fittyfene"
tries Skin/fittyfene.
It first checks
/usr/local/share/mplayer/
and afterwards ~/.mplayer/.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-slave \ \ 
This option switches on slave mode.
This is intended for use of MPlayer as a backend to other programs.
Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer will read simplistic command
lines from its stdin.
.TP
.B \-softsleep
Uses high quality software timers.
As precise as the RTC without requiring special privileges.
Comes at the price of higher CPU consumption.
.TP
.B \-speed <0.01\-100>
Set playback speed rate.
.TP
.B \-sstep <sec>
Specifies seconds between displayed frames.
Useful for slideshows.
.TP
.B \-use-stdin
The standard input (aka. stdin) will be used to read data instead of key
events.  If you open /dev/stdin (or the equivalent on your system), use stdin
in a playlist or intend to read from stdin later on via the openfile or
openlist commands you
.B need
this option.
.
.
.SH "DEMUXER/STREAM OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-aid <id> (also see \-alang option)
Select audio channel [MPEG: 0\-31 AVI/\:OGM: 1\-99 ASF/\:RM: 0\-127
VOB(AC3): 128\-159 VOB(LPCM): 160\-191 MPEG-TS 17\-8190].
MPlayer prints the available IDs when running in verbose (\-v) mode.
When playing an MPEG-TS stream, MPlayer/Mencoder will use the first program 
(if present) with the chosen audio stream.
.TP
.B \-alang <two letter\ country\ code> (also see \-aid option)
Works only for DVD playback.
It selects the DVD audio language and always tries to play audio streams whose
language matches the given code.
For the list of available languages, use with the \-v option and look at the
output.

.I EXAMPLE:
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs "\-alang hu,en"
Plays Hungarian and falls back to English if Hungarian is not available.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-audio-demuxer <number> (\-audiofile only)
Force audio demuxer type for \-audiofile.
Give the demuxer ID as defined in demuxers.h.
Use \-audio-demuxer 17 to force .mp3 detection.
.TP
.B \-audiofile <filename>
Play audio from an external file (WAV, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis) while viewing a
movie.
.TP
.B \-audiofile-cache <kBytes>
Enables caching for the stream used by \-audiofile, using the specified
amount of memory.
.TP
.B \-bandwidth <value>
Specify the maximum bandwidth for network streaming (for servers that are
able to send content in different bitrates).
Useful if you want to watch live streamed media behind a slow connection.
.TP
.B \-cdrom-device <path\ to\ device>
Override default CDROM drive name /dev/\:cdrom.
.TP
.B \-cache <kBytes>
This option specifies how much memory (in kBytes) to use when precaching a
file/\:URL.
Especially useful on slow media (default is \-nocache).
.TP
.B \-cdda <option1:option2>
This option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature of MPlayer.

Available options are:
.
.RSs
.IPs speed=<value>
set CD spin speed
.IPs paranoia=<0\-2>
set paranoia level
.RSss
0: disable checking
.br
1: overlap checking only (default)
.br
2: full data correction and verification
.REss
.IPs generic-dev=<value>
use specified generic SCSI device
.IPs sector-size=<value>
atomic read size
.IPs overlap=<value>
force minimum overlap search during verification to <value> sectors.
.IPs toc-bias
Assume that the beginning offset of track 1 as reported in the TOC will be
addressed as LBA\ 0.
Some Toshiba drives need this for getting track boundaries correct.
.IPs toc-offset=<value>
Add <value> sectors to the values reported when addressing tracks.
May be negative.
.IPs (no)skip
(never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.
.RE
.
.TP
.B \-channels <number>
Change the number of playback channels, defaults to '2' if not specified.
If the number of output channels is bigger than the number of input channels
empty channels are inserted (unless mixing from mono to stereo, then the mono
channel is repeated in both output channels).
If the number of output channels is smaller than the number of input channels,
results depend on the audio decoder (\-afm).
MPlayer asks the decoder to decode the audio into as many channels as
specified.
Now it's up to the decoder to fulfill the requirement.
If the decoder outputs more channels than requested, the exceeding channels
are truncated.
This is usually only important when playing videos with AC3 audio (like DVDs).
In that case liba52 does the decoding by default and correctly downmixes the
audio into the requested number of channels.
.br
.I NOTE:
This option is honored by codecs (AC3 only) filters (surround) and ao drivers
(OSS at least).

Available options are:

.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs 2
stereo
.IPs 4
surround
.IPs 6
full 5.1
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-chapter <chapter\ id>[\-<end\ chapter\ id>]
Specify which chapter to start playing at.
Optionally specify which chapter to end playing at (default: 1).
Examples can be found below.
.TP
.B \-cookies
Send cookies when making HTTP requests.
.TP
.B \-cookies-file <filename>
Read HTTP cookies from this file.
The file is assumed to be in Netscape format.
If you use this option, MPlayer will not look for cookies in ~/.netscape/
and ~/.mozilla/.
.TP
.B \-demuxer <number>
Force demuxer type.
Give the demuxer ID as defined in demuxers.h.
Use \-demuxer 17 to force .mp3 detection.
.TP
.B \-dumpaudio (MPLAYER only)
Dumps raw compressed audio stream to ./\:stream.dump (useful with mpeg/\:ac3).
.TP
.B \-dumpfile <filename> (MPLAYER only)
Specify which file MPlayer should dump to.
Should be used together with \-dumpaudio / \-dumpvideo / \-dumpstream.
.TP
.B \-dumpstream (MPLAYER only)
Dumps the raw stream to ./\:stream.dump.
Useful when ripping from DVD or network.
.TP
.B \-dumpvideo (MPLAYER only)
Dump raw compressed video stream to ./\:stream.dump (not very usable).
.TP
.B \-dvbin <options>
Pass the following parameters to the DVB input module, in order to override
the default ones:

.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs card=<1\-4>
Specifies using card number 1\-4 (default: 1).
.IPs file=<file>
Instructs MPlayer to read the channels list from <file>.
.IPs type=<SAT|TER|CBL>
Specifies that the card type is SATellite, TERrestrial or CaBLe. If not specified
the type will be autodetected.
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-dvd-device <path\ to\ device>
Override default DVD device name /dev/\:dvd.
.TP
.B \-dvdangle <angle\ id>
Some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple angles.
Here you can tell MPlayer which angles to use (default: 1).
Examples can be found below.
.TP
.B \-forceidx
Force rebuilding of INDEX.
Useful for files with broken index (desyncs, etc).
Seeking will be possible.
You can fix the index permanently with MEncoder (see the documentation).
.br
.I NOTE:
You can only use this option if the underlying media supports seeking
(i.e.\& not with stdin, pipe, etc).
.TP
.B \-fps <value>
Override video framerate (if value is wrong/\:missing in the header) (float
number).
.TP
.B \-frames <number>
Play/\:convert only first <number> frames, then quit.
.TP
.B \-hr-mp3-seek (MP3 only)
Hi-res mp3 seeking.
Default is: enabled when playing from external MP3 file, as we need to seek
to the very exact position to keep A/\:V sync.
It can be slow especially when seeking backwards \- it has to rewind to the
beginning to find the exact frame.
.TP
.B \-idx (also see \-forceidx)
Rebuilds INDEX of the AVI if no INDEX was found,
thus allowing seeking.
Useful with broken/\:incomplete downloads, or badly created AVIs.
.br
.I NOTE:
You can only use this option if the underlying media supports seeking
(i.e.\& not with stdin, pipe, etc).
.TP
.B \-ipv4-only-proxy
Skip the proxy for IPv6 addresses.
It will still be used for IPv4 connections.
.TP
.B \-loadidx <filename>
The file name from which to read the video INDEX data, as saved by \-saveidx.
MPlayer will read the index from filename and use this data for seeking.
This data will override any index data contained in the AVI itself.
Further, MPlayer won't prevent you from loading an index file generated
from a different AVI, but this is sure to cause unfavorable results.
.br
.I NOTE:
This option will be obsoleted once AVI gets ODML support!
.TP
.B \-mc <seconds/frame>
Maximum A-V sync correction per frame (in seconds).
.TP
.B \-mf <option1:option2:...>
Used when decoding from multiple PNG or JPEG files.

Available options are:

.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs w=<value>
width of the output (autodetect)
.IPs h=<value>
height of the output (autodetect)
.IPs fps=<value>
fps of the output (default: 25)
.IPs type=<value>
type of input files (available types: jpeg, png, tga, sgi)
.RE
.PD 1
.
.TP
.B \-ni (AVI only)
Force usage of non-interleaved AVI parser (fixes playing

Do not use average byte/\:sec value for A-V sync (AVI).
Helps with some AVI files with broken header.
.TP
.B \-noextbased
Disables filename-extension based demuxer selection.
By default, when file type (demuxer) cannot be detected reliably
(the file has no header or it is not reliable enough), the filename
extension is used to select demuxer.  It always falls back to content-based
demuxer selection.

.B \-rtsp-stream-over-tcp
Used with 'rtsp://' URLs to specify that the resulting incoming RTP and RTCP
packets be streamed over TCP (using the same TCP connection as RTSP).
This option may be useful if you have a broken Internet connection that does
not pass incoming UDP packets (see http://www.live.com/mplayer/).
.TP
.B \-saveidx <filename>
Force rebuilding of INDEX and output to a separate file specified by the
argument filename.
Currently this only works with AVI files.
Although you can use MEncoder to fix files without indexes, the AVI
container format is limited to indexing files up to 2GB in size.
It is however possible to store the index in a separate file and use it later
with \-loadidx, which is faster than rebuilding the index (with \-idx or
\-forceidx) each time the movie is opened.
(This is a limitation of the AVI format, and although there exists an
extension to index beyond 2GB, MPlayer doesn't yet support this extension.)
After the index file is created, MPlayer will begin to play the video.
If you want to automate index file generation (after encoding a large file
off a TV capture card, for example), you can specify \-frames 0 to
prevent MPlayer from playing the video after generating the index.
.br
.I NOTE:
This option will be obsoleted once AVI gets ODML support!

.B \-sb <byte\ position> (see \-ss option too)

.B \-tv <option1:option2:...>
This option tunes various properties of the TV capture module.
For watching TV with MPlayer, use 'tv://' or 'tv://<channel_number>' 
or even 'tv://<channel_name> (see option channels for channel_name below)
as a movie URL.

Be advised that although you can select any samplerate when using ALSA,
the LAME audio codec is able to encode only the 'standard' samplerates.

Use _ for spaces in names (or play with quoting ;-).
The channel names will then be written using OSD, and the commands tv_step_channel,
tv_set_channel and tv_last_channel will then be usable using a remote (see lirc).
Not compatible with frequency parameter.
Warning: The channel number will then be the position in the 'channels' list,
beginning with 1.

.B eq2[=gamma:contrast:brightness:saturation:rg:gg:bg:weight]
Alternative software equalizer that uses lookup tables (very slow),
allowing gamma correction in addition to simple brightness

Note that it uses the same MMX optimized code as \-vf eq if all
gamma values are 1.0.
The parameters are given as floating point values.
Parameters rg, gg, bg are the independent gamma values for the Red, Green
and Blue components.
The weight parameter can be used to reduce the effect of a high gamma value on
bright image areas, e.g.\& keep them from getting overamplified and just plain
white.
A value of 0.0 turns the gamma correction all the way down while 1.0 leaves it
at its full strength.
Defaults are gamma=1.0, contrast=1.0, brightness=0.0, saturation=1.0,
weight=1.0.
Value ranges are 0.1\-10 for gamma, -2\-2 for contrast (negative values result
in a negative image), -1\-1 for brightness, 0\-3 for saturation and 0\-1 for
weight.

.B halfpack[=f]
Convert planar YUV 4:2:0 to half-height packed 4:2:2, downsampling luma but

Useful for output to low-resolution display devices when hardware downscaling
is poor quality or is not available.
Can also be used as a primitive luma-only deinterlacer with very low cpu
usage.
By default, halfpack averages pairs of lines when downsampling.
The optional parameter f can be 0 to only use even lines, or 1 to only use
odd lines.
Any other value for f gives the default (averaging) behavior.
.TP
.B ilpack[=mode]
When interlaced video is stored in YUV 4:2:0 formats, chroma
interlacing does not line up properly due to vertical downsampling of
the chroma channels.
This filter packs the planar 4:2:0 data into YUY2 (4:2:2) format with
the chroma lines in their proper locations, so that in any given
scanline, the luma and chroma data both come from the same field.
The optional argument selects the sampling mode.
By default, linear interpolation (mode 1) is used.
Mode 0 uses nearest-neighbor sampling, which is fast but incorrect.
.TP
.B decimate[=max:hi:lo:frac]
Drops frames that don't differ greatly from the previous frame in
order to reduce framerate.
The argument max (if positive) sets the maximum number of consecutive
frames which can be dropped, or (if negative) the minimum interval
between dropped frames.
A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 region differs by more
than a threshold of hi, and if not more than frac portion (1 meaning
the whole image) differs by more than a threshold of lo.
Values of hi and lo are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actual
pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64 corresponds to 1 unit of
difference for each pixel, or the same spread out differently over the
block.
The main use of this filter is for very-low-bitrate encoding (e.g.\&
streaming over dialup modem), but it could in theory be used for
fixing movies that were inverse-telecined incorrectly.

.B il=[d|i][s][:[d|i][s]]

The goal of this filter is to add the ability to process interlaced images
pre-field without deinterlacing them.
You can filter your interlaced DVD and play it on a TV without breaking the
interlacing.
While deinterlacing (with the postprocessing filter) removes interlacing
permanently (by smoothing, averaging, etc) deinterleaving splits the frame into
2 fields (so called half pictures), so you can process (filter) them
independently and then re-interleave them.

its behavior:
.RSs
.IPs dr
Set the frame dropping mode.
0 (default) means don't drop frames to maintain fixed output framerate.
1 means always drop a frame when there have been no drops or telecine
merges in the past 5 frames.

.I NOTE:

Available values are 0 (fixed pattern with initial frame number
specified by fr=#) and 1 (agressive search for telecine pattern).
Default is 1.
.IPs fr

0\-2 are the three clean progressive frames; 3 and 4 are the two
interlaced frames.
The default, -1, means 'not in telecine sequence'.

.IPs "tr0, tr1, tr2, tr3"

.RE
.TP
.B ivtc[=1]
Experimental 'stateless' inverse telecine filter.
Rather than trying to lock on to a pattern like the detc filter does,
ivtc makes its decisions independently for each frame.
This will give much better results for material that has undergone
heavy editing after telecine was applied, but as a result it is not as
forgiving of noisy input, for example TV capture.
The optional parameter (ivtc=1) corresponds to the dr=1 option for the
detc filter, and should be used with MEncoder but not with MPlayer.
As with detc, you must specify the correct output framerate (\-ofps
23.976) when using MEncoder.
.TP
.B pullup\ 
Third-generation pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter,
capable of handling mixed hard-telecine, 24 fps progressive, and 30
fps progressive content.
The pullup filter is designed to be much more robust than detc or
ivtc, but it is still under development.
No configuration options are available yet.
As the underlying pulldown reversal engine is designed to take
advantage of the new features in MPlayer G2, the current
implementation in G1 is meant to serve mainly as a testbed.
.I NOTE:
Presently pullup lacks any way to cap the output framerate, so
during 30 fps progressive sequences or stills, it will output more
than 24 fps, meaning you'll have trouble if you use it with mencoder
\-ofps 23.976.
.TP
.B filmdint[=options]
Inverse telecine filter, similar to the pullup filter above.
It is designed to handle any pulldown pattern, including mixed soft and
hard telecine and limited support for movies that are slowed down or sped
up from their original framerate for TV.
Only the luma plane is used to find the frame breaks.
If a field has no match, it is deinterlaced with simple linear
approximation.
If the source is MPEG-2, libmpeg2 must be used for decoding (not
ffmpeg2!), and this must be the first filter to allow access to the
field-flags set by the MPEG-2 decoder.
Depending on the source mpeg, you may be fine ignoring this advice, as
long as you do not see lots of "Bottom-first field" warnings.
With no options it does normal inverse telecine, and should be used
together with mencoder \-fps 29.97 \-ofps 23.976.
When this filter is used with mplayer, it will result in an uneven
framerate during playback, but it is still generally better than using
pp=lb or no deinterlacing at all.
Multiple options can be specified separated by /.
.RSs
.IPs crop=w:h:x:y
Just like the crop filter, but faster, and works on mixed hard and soft
telecined content as well as when y is not a multiple of 4.
If x or y would require cropping fractional pixels from the chroma
planes, the crop area is extended.
This usually means that x and y must be even.
.IPs io=ifps:ofps
For each ifps input frames the filter will output ofps frames.
The ratio of ifps/ofps should match the \-fps/\-ofps ratio.
This could be used to filter movies that are broadcast on TV at a frame
rate different from their original frame rate.
.IPs luma_only=n
If n is nonzero, the chroma plane is copied unchanged.
This is useful for YV12 sampled TV, which discards one of the chroma
fields.
.IPs mmx2=n
On x86, if n=1, use MMX2 optimized functions, if n=2, use 3DNow!
optimized functions, othewise, use plain C.
If this option is not specified, MMX2 and 3DNow! are auto-detected, use
this option to override auto-detection.
.IPs fast=n
The larger n will speed up the filter at the expense of accuracy.
The default value is n=3.
If n is odd, a frame immediately following a frame marked with the
REPEAT_FIRST_FIELD mpeg flag is assumed to be progressive, thus filter
will not spend any time on soft-telecined MPEG-2 content.
This is the only effect of this flag if MMX2 or 3DNow! is available.
Without MMX2 and 3DNow, if n=0 or 1, the same calculations will be used
as with n=2 or 3.
If n=2 or 3, the number of luma levels used to find the frame breaks is
reduced from 256 to 128, which results in a faster filter without losing
much accuracy.
If n=4 or 5, a faster, but much less accurate metric will be used to
find the frame breaks, which is more likely to misdetect high vertical
detail as interlaced content.
.IPs verbose=n
If n is nonzero, print the detailed metrics for each frame.
Useful for debugging.
.IPs dint_thres=n
Deinterlace threshold.
Used during de-interlacing of unmatched frames.
Larger value means less deinterlacing, use n=256 to completely turn off
deinterlacing.
Default is n=8.
.IPs comb_thres=n

Defaults to 128.

.B softpulldown
This filter works only correct with MEncoder and acts on the MPEG2 flags
used for soft 3:2 pulldown (soft telecine).
If you want to use the ivtc or detc filter on movies that are partly soft
telecined, inserting this filter before them should make them more reliable.
Currently only libmpeg2 exports the needed flags.
If used on material that does not set them or if using ffmpeg12, the
filter does nothing.

.B telecine[=start]
Apply 3:2 'telecine' process to increase framerate by 20%.

Both fps options are essential!

.B framestep=I|[i]step
Renders only every nth frame or every Intra (key) frame.

If you call the filter with I (uppercase) as the parameter, then ONLY 
keyframes are rendered.
For DVDs it generally means one in every 15/12  frames (IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB),
for AVI it means every scene change or every keyint value (see \-lavcopts
keyint= value if you use MEncoder to encode the video).

When a key frame is found, an 'I!' string followed by a newline character is
printed, leaving the current line of mplayer/mencoder output on the screen,
because it contains the time (in seconds) and frame number of the keyframe
(You can use this information to split the AVI.).

If you call the filter with a numeric parameter 'step' then only one in
every 'step' frames is rendered.

If you put an 'i' (lowercase) before the number then an I! is printed 
(like the I parameter).

If you give only the i then nothing is done to the frames, only I! is 
printed.

Keyframes are needed for seeking as seeking is only possible to a keyframe but
keyframes need more space than other frames so larger numbers here mean
slightly smaller files, but less precise seeking, 0 means no key frames.
Values >300 are not recommended as the quality might be bad depending upon
decoder, encoder and luck.

this will also store a fake divx version in the file so the bug
autodetection of some decoders might be confused
.TP
.B divx5bvop
generate DivX5 compatible B-frames (default=on)
.TP
.B qpel\ \ \ 
enable quarter-pixel motion estimation (default=off)
.TP
.B gmc\ \ \ \ 
enable global motion compensation, may save bits on panning scenes (default=off)
.TP
.B chroma_me
uses chroma information to estimate motion (default=off)
.TP
.B chroma_opt
enable a chroma optimizer prefilter (default=off)
.TP
.B reduced
enable encoding reduced resolution frames (default=off)
.TP
.B max_bframes=<0\-4>
maximum number of B frames to put between I/P frames (default=0)
.TP
.B bquant_ratio=<0\-1000>
quantizer ratio between B and non B frames, 150=1.50 (default=150)
.TP
.B bquant_offset=<-1000\-1000>
quantizer offset between B and non B frames, 100=1.00 (default=100)
.TP
.B bf_threshold=<-255\-255>
change the probability of a frame to be a bframe (default=0)
.TP
.B hq_ac\ \ 
enable a better prediction of AC component (default=off)
.TP
.B vhq=<0\-4>
enable a higher quality ME search using DCT, faster to slower:
.PD 0
.RSs
.IPs 0
off (default)
.IPs 1
mode decision (inter/intra MB)
.IPs 2
limited search
.IPs 3
medium search
.IPs 4
wide search
.RE
.PD 1
.TP
.B aspect=<x/y | f (float value)>
Store movie aspect internally, just like MPEG files.
Much nicer solution than rescaling, because quality isn't decreased.
MPlayer and few others players will play these files correctly, others will display
them with the wrong aspect.
The aspect parameter can be given as a ratio or a floating point number.
.TP
.B autoaspect
Same as the aspect option, but automatically computes aspect, taking
into account all the adjustments (crop/expand/scale/etc.) made in the
filter chain.
.TP
.B psnr\ \ \ 
Print the psnr (peak signal to noise ratio) for the whole video after encoding
and store the per frame psnr in a file with a name like 'psnr_hhmmss.log'.
Returned values are in dB (decibel), the higher the better.
