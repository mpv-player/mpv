CONTEXT MENU
============

The context menu is a menu that pops up on the video window. By default, it is
bound to right click.

menu.conf
---------

You can define your own menu in ``~~/menu.conf`` (see `FILES`_), or an
alternative path specified with ``--script-opt=select-menu_conf_path``. It is
recommended to use the default ``menu.conf`` from
https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/menu.conf as an example to get
started.

Each line of ``menu.conf`` is a menu item with fields separated by 1 or more
tabs. The first field is the text shown in the menu. The second field is usually
the command that is run when that item is selected. Fields from the third
onwards can specify ``checked=``, ``disabled=`` and ``hidden=`` states in the
same way as `Conditional auto profiles`_.

When there is no command, the item will open a submenu. Fields below indented
with leading whitespace are added to this submenu. Nested submenu items are
defined by adding more leading whitespace than the parent menu entry.

Empty lines are interpreted as separators.

The second field can also be one of the following tokens to make that entry a
submenu with the relative items: ``$playlist``, ``$video-tracks``,
``$audio-tracks``, ``$sub-tracks``, ``$secondary-sub-tracks``, ``$chapters``,
``$editions``, ``$audio-devices``. These menus are automatically disabled when
empty.

To use the native context menu, you need to fill the ``menu-data`` property with
menu definition data, and call the ``context-menu`` command. In builtin scripts,
this is done by ``select.lua``, which parses ``menu.conf`` to populate
``menu-data``. It then calls the ``context-menu`` command on platforms where
integration with the native context menu is implemented, while on platforms
where it is not, it opens ``context_menu.lua``.

On platforms without integration with the native context menu,
``context_menu.lua`` can be disabled entirely using the
``--load-context-menu=no`` option. On platforms where the integration is
implemented, it is already disabled by default, and ``--load-context-menu=yes``
will make ``select.lua`` use it.

Script messages
---------------

``open``
    Show the context menu.

``select``
    Select the focused item when there is one.

Configuration
-------------

This script can be customized through a config file
``script-opts/context_menu.conf`` placed in mpv's user directory and through
the ``--script-opts`` command-line option. The configuration syntax is
described in `mp.options functions`_.
