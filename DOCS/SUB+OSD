SUBTITLES
---------
Yes, mplayer also supports many kinds of subtitles. Currently (2001/06/01)
7 kinds of subtitle can be used by the subreader code. To see what are
these subtitle formats, see subreader.c, line ~20.

Subtitles are displayed with a technique called 'OSD', On Screen Display.
OSD is used to display current time, volume bar, seek bar etc.


INSTALLING OSD and SUB
----------------------

You need an mplayer font package to be able to use OSD/SUB feature.
There are many ways to get it:

1. use the font generator tool at TOOLS/subfont-c
   It's a complete tool to convert from TTF/Type1/etc font to mplayer font pkg.
   (read TOOLS/subfont-c/README for details)

2. use the font generator GIMP plugin at TOOLS/subfont-GIMP
   (note: you must have HSI RAW plugin too, see URL bellow)

3. download ready-to-use font packages from mplayer site.
   Note: currently available fonts are only for limited iso 8859-1/2 support,
   and there is a few special version for korean, russian etc codepages.
   You'd better building font yourself with tool mentioned above.
   
   some usefull URLs:
   ftp://ftp.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/         - ISO fonts, OBSOLETED!
   ftp://ftp.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/contrib/fonts/    - various fonts by users
   http://realtime.ssu.ac.kr/~lethean/mplayer       - korean fonts & RAW plugin

After that, UNZIP the files to ~/.mplayer/font/
Now you have to see a clock at the upper left corner of the movie
(switch it off with 'o')

OSD has 3 states: (switch with 'o')
    - clock + volume bar + seek bar + sub     (default)
    - volume bar + seek bar + sub
    - only sub

You can change default behaviour by setting osdlevel= variable in config file.
