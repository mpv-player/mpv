#######################################

Thanks for reading MPlayer documentation !!!


1. For "release" version users (i.e. non-CVS):

   a, Enter the HTML/ directory, and there you'll find the documentation,
      each language in its of subdirectory.

   b, If the HTML/ directory doesn't contain your language, try the
      subdirectories in this very same folder.


2. For "development" version users (i.e. CVS or CVS snapshots):

   a, Enter the xml/ directory, and read the README file there.
      Find the created documentation in the HTML/ directory.

   b, If the xml/ directory doesn't contain your language, try the
      subdirectories in this very same folder.
