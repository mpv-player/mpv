## MPlayer config file
##
## This file can be copied to /etc/mplayer.conf and/or ~/.mplayer/config .
## If both exist, the ~/.mplayer/config's settings override the
## /etc/mplayer.conf ones. And, of course command line overrides all.
## The options are the same as in the command line, but they can be specified
## more flexibly here. See below.
##

vo=xv			# To specify default video driver (see -vo help for
			# list)

ao=oss			# To specify default audio driver (see -ao help for
			# list)

fs=yes			# Enlarges movie window to your desktop's size.
			# Used by drivers: all

vm=no			# Tries to change to a different videomode
			# Used by drivers: dga2, x11, sdl

#bpp=0			# Force changing display depth.
			# Valid settings are: 0, 15, 16, 24, 32
			# may need 'vm=yes' too.
			# Used by drivers: fbdev, dga2, svga

zoom=no			# Enable software scaling (powerful CPU needed)
			# Used by drivers: svga, aalib

# x=800			# scale movie to <x> pixels width
# y=600			# scale movie to <y> pixels height

## FBdev driver: specify your monitor's timings, so resolutions
## can be autodetected.
## (see for example /etc/X11/XF86Config for timings!)
## ** CAUTION! IF YOUR DISPLAY DOESN'T SUPPORT AUTOMATICALLY TURNING OFF WHEN
##    OVERDRIVED (AND EVEN IF IT DOES), THIS MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR DISPLAY!
##    WE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE, IT'S YOUR DECISION! **

## SDL driver
##

# vo = sdl:aalib	# use SDL video driver by default
			# use "vo = sdl:aalib" or "vo sdl:dga" and so on,
			# for specifying SDL subdrivers
# ao = sdl:esd		# use SDL audio driver by default
			# use "ao = sdl:esd" to use SDL's ESD driver
# noxv = no		# whether to use XVideo hardware acceleration or not
# forcexv = yes		# force XVideo even if not detected

# nodshow		# disable usage of DirectShow video codecs


framedrop = yes		# drop frames, when not in sync (slow CPU, videocard,
			# etc)

## You can also include other configfiles
## Specify full path!
