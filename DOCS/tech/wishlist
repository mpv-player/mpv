Small improvements:

   (maybe there should be an option - some people seem to like it the
   way it is, but then fbdev should also behave like this..)

 * Debian package creates mplayer.conf.1 .2 ...

 * Make the output windows remember their positions when resizing to
   double size.

 * Ability to resize to full size/double size/triple (or half) size
   upon key presses.

 * add help suboption to -lavcopts vcodec=/acodec=, -lavfopts format=,
   -tv driver=, -subcp, and anything else that needs it.


Cleanup:

 * integrate dvdnav into mplayer structure

 * integrate libmpdvdkit2 into mplayer structure (message system and
   command line options)
