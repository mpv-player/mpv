A documentation about MPlayer's man page
========================================


About the documentation
-----------------------

Yes it's true: This is the documentation of the documentation (man page).
This guide should be used as a reference for questions about the man page
structure. It's not a strict guide but we recommend following it to get a
uniform man page.



What belongs in the man page?
-----------------------------

    - option descriptions (all)
    - usage (options, config files, controls, slave mode)
    - basic examples



What doesn't belong in the man page?
------------------------------------

    - instructions for installation, encoding and similar processes
    - detailed evaluations or hints
    - tutorials, guides



How should patches look like?
-----------------------------

Follow the rules in patches.txt, they apply to the man page, too.
Exceptions are:

    - Cosmetic patches are allowed but should be done separately from the real
      changes, be marked as cosmetic changes and shouldn't change the general
      style without reasons/permissions.
    - The same applies to spell checking.



How do I create an HTML, text or other version of the man page?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The man page was more or less designed for groff as it is the main tool for
it. Therefore only groff produces acceptable results without changes.
Additionally, the SS variable should be set to either very low or very high
values to produce a better groff HTML output (Due to a bug of groff2html?).
A setting of 4 should look readable. Here's an overview again:

    - groff:     Groff is the "official" tool to convert man pages.
                 To get good results you need a recent version (1.18.2).
                 cat mplayer.1 | sed s/SS\ 20/SS\ 4/ | groff -man -Thtml - > manpage.html
                 groff -rLL=64n -m man -Tascii mplayer.1 | col -bx > manpage.txt
                 The groff man page lists other output formats to use with -T.
    - man2html:  You can view it through a CGI script:
                 http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html?mplayer
                 The output is unusable as the script doesn't seem to support
                 the macro definitions. Maybe manually changing all leads to
                 acceptable results.
    - rman:      rman -f html mplayer.1 > manpage.rman.html
                 The output is ugly as rman doesn't understand many of the
                 macros used.
    - troffcvt:  troff2html -man mplayer.1 > manpage.tcvt.html
                 The (good) output is similar to groff but simplified...



The structure
-------------

The option descriptions are divided into sections. Inside a section options are
alphabetically sorted. The sections are:

(Header)
    Not visible, copyright and author information.
(Macro definitions)
    Not visible, some macro definitions.
NAME
    The man page is used for both mplayer and mencoder.
SYNOPSIS
    A description of MPlayer's playtree.
DESCRIPTION
    A general description of MPlayer, MEncoder, GMPlayer and its features.
GENERAL NOTES
    Some general notes about the options and a description of the config file
    format.
PLAYER OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
    User interface option descriptions (MPlayer only).
DEMUXER/STREAM OPTIONS
    Demuxer and stream layer option descriptions.
OSD/SUB OPTIONS
    This section is special in that it contains all subtitle and OSD option
    descriptions even if they might belong to one of the other sections. It was
    created because of its size.
AUDIO OUTPUT OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
    Audio output layer (ao) option descriptions (MPlayer only).
VIDEO OUTPUT OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
    Video output layer (vo) option descriptions (MPlayer only).
DECODING/FILTERING OPTIONS
    Decoding and filter layer options (ad, vd, vf, pl).
ENCODING OPTIONS (MENCODER ONLY)
    Encoding option descriptions (ve) (MEncoder only).
KEYBOARD CONTROL
    A description of MPlayer's input system and the default keyboard controls.
SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
    A description of the slave mode protocol (-slave).
FILES
    A list and description of all installed/used files/directories.
EXAMPLES
    Basic examples. Again: no long descriptions/processes.

"Style" guidelines
------------------

This section was kept simple but there are certain guidelines/rules to get a
uniform man page. The best way is to read (and understand) the source.


General:

    - No line should contain more than 79 characters.
    - Used commands: .TH, .SH, .TP, .IP, .PP, .[R]B, .I, .br, .RS, .RE, .na,
                     .nh, .ad, .hy, macro definitions, comments and some more
    - Don't forget the quotation marks around expressions, the backslash
      before a '-' if it's needed, etc...


Option descriptions:

    - Option and/or suboption parameters should be short, descriptive and put
      in angular brackets (e.g. \-vo <driver>).
    - If the option has a parameter in a certain range, specify it right after
      the option (e.g. \-subpos <0\-100>).
    - Optional things should be put in square brackets ([]).
    - Obsolete options are followed by (OBSOLETE), beta options by
      (BETA CODE), etc.
    - MPlayer only options in a section which isn't marked this way
      are followed by (MPLAYER only).
    - Add references to other options if they belong to each other, e.g.
      '(\-vo zr only)' or '(also see \-alang)' or are commonly used together.
    - If a nontrivial default parameter exists, mention it, e.g. (default: 24).
    - Put examples and notes at the end of the description (before suboptions).
    - The end of the suboptions _always_ has to be followed by a paragraph
      (BUG).


Macro definitions (see beginning of man page):

    - SS      Starting value of the suboption column
    - .IPs    Add new suboption (we use .TP for normal options and .IP for
              the rest)
    - .RSs    Begin of suboptions, end with .RE
    - .RSss   Begin of suboptions in a suboption
    - .REss   End of suboptions in a suboption


Options, suboptions, examples structure:
