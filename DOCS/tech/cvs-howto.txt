About CVS write access:      by A'rpi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I. TECH SIDE:
=============
1. Changing password:

  As you probably got a restricted CVS-only shell, it's not trivial:

  ssh LOGIN@mplayerhq.hu passwd
  
  (replace LOGIN with your loginname. leave 'passwd' unchanged, it's command)
  
  Note: if you need real shell for something, tell me.

2. Checkout devel. source tree:
  
  export CVS_RSH=ssh
  cvs -z3 -d:ext:LOGIN@mplayerhq.hu:/cvsroot/mplayer co main
  
3. Commiting changes:

  cvs -z3 commit -m "comment - what and why did you change" filename(s)
  
4. Adding new files/dirs:

  cvs add filename/dirname
  
5. Removing files:

  rm filename
  cvs remove filename
  
6. Check changes:
  
  cvs -z3 diff -u filename(s)
  
7. Check changelog:

  cvs -z3 log filename(s)
  
8. Rename/move files:

  you can't do that. ask CVS server admin (A'rpi) to do it.
  (do not remove & re-add file - it will kill changelog!)

If you have any tech problems with cvs server, contact me:

II. POLICY / RULES:
===================

1. You shouldn't commit code which makes cvs broken!
   (i mean unfinished but enabled code which break
    compiling or compiles but does not work)

2. You don't have over-test things. if it works for you,
   and you think it should work for others too, then commit.
   If it has problems (portability, exploits compiler bugs,
   unusual environment etc) they will be reported, it's ok.

3. You can commit unfinished stuff (for testing etc), but it
   must be disabled (#ifdef etc) by default.

4. Do not change behaviour of the program (renaming options etc)
   without discussing first at the MPlayer-dev-eng list.

5. Source indenting and other cosmetical changes are refused.
   I'll remove those commits...
   Every developer has its own indenting style, you shouldn't
   change it. Of course if you (re)write something then you can
   use your own style...
   (Many projects forces a given indenting style - we don't)

6. Always fill out the comment at commiting (-m switch of cvs, or
   in the editor if you left -m).
   It shouldn't be such lines: "fixed!" or "Changed it."
   Describe in a few lines (usually 1 line is enough) what did
   you changed and why did you that. You can refer mails if bugfix.

7. If you apply patch by someone else, include his name and email
   in the cvs comment!

8. I've developed something called CVS-Backup. It archives CVS
   repository after each commit - so I can reverse your commits
   (without messing up changelog) if they are bad.
   
   
I think our rules aren't too hard. If you have comments, contact me.
