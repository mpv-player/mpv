FOR THE RELEASE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

demuxer:
- prebuffering to cache2 (req. for MMS)
- test and cleanup FLI/FLC support (and implement seek)

decoders:
- getting -ss working perfect with MPEG-PES and also seeking (real 1 Minute etc)
- getting vivo audio DLL codec working...
- getting mss1 (Windows Screen Video) DLL codec working...
- getting PIM1 codec working...
- optimize (or port optimized code from libac3) liba52 (imdct.c, resample.c)

mencoder:
- add some kind of "-ss" option, to start at e.g. 1:0:0 at the video
- add a endpoint for encoding, like above
- finish 3-pass encoding (audio, video1, video2)
- add ffmpeg encoders support
- add win32 encoders support
- add raw video out
- check/fix frame copy
- implement VBR audio copy
- Estimated Size and Time
- image cut/crop filter

other:
- fix DVB a-v sync problems, switch to mp1e

runtime:
- add --enable-runtime or something (should change VERSION header and enable
  runtime cpu detect and print banner telling users to recompile for speed)
- runtime cpu detection in: 
     vo_dga.c (asm stuff may be removed and replaced by fastmemcpy?)
     libac3 (should be ported to liba52)
     

FUTURE:
~~~~~~~

demuxer:
- implement forward seeking in indexed avi streams
- implement brute-force broken avi fixer

decoders:
- check and import videodecoding.de stuff
- qtx support?
- define some common api for native audio and video codecs
  and move them to seperated place (hopefully will allow adding new
  codecs without having to modify mplayer core code, also would speed
  up by limiting number of select statements)

mencoder:
- add ogg/vorbis audio encoder
- stop/resume

gui:
- playlist ?
- preferences ?

other:
- dvd server
- sub database
- mga_vid crtc2 fix
- make mach64_vid
- libvo2
- display OSD and subtitles using DVB card's OSD
