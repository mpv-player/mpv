Short description of video path:
1. mplayer/mencoder core requests the decoding of a compressed video frame:
   calls decvideo.c::decode_video()

2. decode_video() calls the previously ( init_video() ) selected video codec
   (vd_XXXX.c file, where XXXX == vfm name, see the 'driver' line of codecs.conf)

3. the codec should initialize output device before decoding the first frame,
   it may happen in init() or at the middle of the first decode(). see 3.a.
   it means calling vd.c::mpcodecs_config_vo() with the image dimensions,
   and the _preferred_ (mean: internal, native, best) colorspace.
   NOTE: this colorspace may not be equal to the actually used colorspace, it's
   just a _hint_ for the csp matching algorithm, and mainly used _only_ when
   csp conversion is required, as input format of the converter.

3.a. selecting the best output colorspace:
   the vd.c::mpcodecs_config_vo() function will go through the outfmt list
   defined by codecs.conf's 'out' lines, and query both vd (codec) and vo
   (output device/filter/encoder) if it's supported or not.

   For the vo, it calls the query_format() func of vf_XXX.c or ve_XXX.c.
   It should return a set of feature flags, the most important ons for this
   stage are: VFCAP_CSP_SUPPORTED (csp supported directly or by conversion)
   and VFCAP_CSP_SUPPORTED_BY_HW (csp supported WITHOUT any conversion).

   For the vd (codec), control() with VDCTRL_QUERY_FORMAT will be called.
   If it doesn't implement VDCTRL_QUERY_FORMAT, (ie answers CONTROL_UNKNOWN
   or CONTROL_NA) it will be assumed to be CONTROL_TRUE (csp supported)!

   So, by default, if the list of supported colorspaces is constant, doesn't
   depend on the actual file's/stream's header, it's enough to list them
   in codecs.conf ('out' field), and don't implement VDCTRL_QUERY_FORMAT.
   It's the case for the most codecs.
   
   If the supported csp list depends on the file being decoded, list the
   possible out formats (colorspaces) in codecs.conf, and implement the
   VDCTRL_QUERY_FORMAT to test the availability of the given csp for the
   given video file/stream.
   
   The vd.c core will find the best matching colorspace, depending on the
   VFCAP_CSP_SUPPORTED_BY_HW flag (see vfcap.h). If no match at all, it
   will try again with the 'scale' filter inserted between vd and vo.
   If still no match, it will fail :(

4. requesting buffer for the decoded frame:
   The codec have to call mpcodecs_get_image() with proper imgtype & imgflag.
   It will find the optimal buffering setup (preferred stride, alignment etc)
   and return a pointer to the allocated and filled up mpi (mp_image_t*) struct.
   The 'imgtype' controls the buffering setup, ie STATIC (just one buffer,
   it 'remembers' its contents between frames), TEMP (write-only, full update),
   EXPORT (memory allocation is done by the codec, not recommended) and so on.
   The 'imgflags' set up the limits for the buffer, ie stride limitations,
   readability, remembering content etc. See mp_image.h for the short descr.
   See dr-methods.txt for the explanation of buffer importing and mpi imgtypes.
   
   Always try to implement stride support! (stride == bytes per line)
   If no stride support, then stride==bytes_per_pixel*image_width.
   If you have stride supoprt in your decoder, use the mpi->stride[] value
   for the byte_per_line for each plane.
   Also take care of other imgflags, like MP_IMGFLAG_PRESERVE and
   MP_IMGFLAG_READABLE, MP_IMGFLAG_COMMON_STRIDE and MP_IMGFLAG_COMMON_PLANE!
   The file mp_image.h contains description of flags in comments, read it!
   Ask for help on -dev-eng, describing the behaviour your codec, if unsure.

4.a. buffer allocation, vd.c::mpcodecs_get_image():
   If the requested buffer imgtype!=EXPORT, then vd.c will try to do
   direct rendering, ie. asks the next filter/vo for the buffer allocation.
   It's done by calling get_image() of the vf_XXX.c file.
   If it was successful, the imgflag MP_IMGFLAG_DIRECT will be set, and one
   memcpy() will be saved when passing the data from vd to the next filter/vo.
   See dr-methods.txt for details and examples.

5. decode the frame, to the mpi structure requested at 4, then return the mpi
   to decvideo.c. Return NULL if the decoding failed or skipped frame.

6. decvideo.c::decode_video() will now pass the 'mpi' to the next filter (vf_X).

7. the filter's (vf_X) put_image() then requests a new mpi buffer by calling
   vf.c::vf_get_image().

7.a. vf.c::vf_get_image() will try to get direct rendering, by asking the
     next fliter to do the buffer allocation (calls vf_Y's get_image()).
     if it fails, it will fallback to normal system memory allocation.

8. when we're over the whole filter chain (multiple filters can be connected,
   even the same filter multiple times) then the last, 'leaf' filter will be
   called. The only difference between leaf and non-leaf filter is that leaf
   filter have to implement the whole filter api.
   Leaf filters are now: vf_vo.c (wrapper over libvo) and ve_XXX.c (video
   encoders used by mencoder).
