SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
-------------------

The -slave option switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend
for other programs. Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer will read
commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.

To try slave mode out by hand, run

  mplayer -slave -quiet <movie>

and type slave commands into the console window.

You can also use a fifo file (named pipe):

  mkfifo </tmp/fifofile>
  mplayer -slave -input file=</tmp/fifofile> <movie>

Most slave mode commands are equivalent to command line options, though not
necessarily under the same name. Detailed descriptions can be found in the
man page.

All commands can be prefixed with one of "pausing ", "pausing_keep ", or
"pausing_toggle ". "pausing " tells MPlayer to pause as soon as possible
after processing the command. "pausing_keep " tells MPlayer to do so only if
it was already in paused mode. "pausing_toggle " tells MPlayer to do so
only if it was not already in paused mode. Please note that "as soon as
possible" can be before the command is fully executed.
As a temporary hack, there is also the _experimental_ "pausing_keep_force "
prefix, with which MPlayer will not exit the pause loop at all.
Like this you can avoid the "frame stepping" effect of "pausing_keep "
but most commands will either not work at all or behave in unexpected ways.


Available commands ('mplayer -input cmdlist' will print a list):


alt_src_step <value> (ASX playlist only)
    When more than one source is available it selects the next/previous one.

The following commands are really only useful for OSD menu console mode:

help
    Displays help text, currently empty.

exit
    Exits from OSD menu console. Unlike 'quit', does not quit MPlayer.

hide
    Hides the OSD menu console. Clicking a menu command unhides it. Other
    keybindings act as usual.

run <value>
    Run <value> as shell command. In OSD menu console mode stdout and stdin
    are through the video output driver.
