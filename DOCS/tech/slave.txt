SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
-------------------

FIXME: Some of these options are still not documented, patches welcome.

Most slave mode commands are equivalent to command line options.

Each line must contain one of the following commands:

seek <value> [<type>]
    Seek to some place in the movie.
        0 is a relative seek of +/- <value> seconds (default).
        1 is a seek to <value> % in the movie.
