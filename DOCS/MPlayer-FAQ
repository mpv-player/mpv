Yes, this is the MPlayer FAQ.
=============================

About:
~~~~~~
Many people asked same questions so I decided to write this stuff.
I know that people will never read this but at least i try to
pull down number of these mails.
And from now i can say that "read the fuckin' FAQ!" :-)

Let's ask!
~~~~~~~~~~
Q: SDL output doesn't work or compile. Problem is ....
A: It works only with SDL v1.1.7 (and maybe newer)
   It does NOT work with 1.1.6, 1.1.5 1.1.4 1.1.3 1.0.4 etc, don't ask.

Q: I am still having trouble compiling with SDL support. gcc says something
   about "undefined reference to `SDL_EnableKeyRepeat'"   What's now?
A: Where did you install the SDL library? If you installed in /usr/local
   (the default) then edit the top level config.mak and add
   "-L/usr/local/lib " after "X_LIBS=" Now type make. You're done!

Q: I have problem ... with the SDL driver.
A: It's very experimental & buggy code, and it's UNSUPPORTED by us.
   Please do NOT report bugs or ask features relating to SDL.
   But you can improve it, and send us patches!

Q: It doesn't compile, and it misses uint64_t inttypes.h and similar things...
A: copy DOCS/inttypes.h to MPlayer directory (cp DOCS/inttypes.h .)
   try again... if fail, contact me

Q: I have Pentium III but ./configure doesn't detect SSE
A: Only kernel versions 2.4.x supports SSE (or try latest 2.2.19 or newer)

Q: fullscreen option (-fs) and/or -xy doesn't work with x11 driver (-vo x11)
A: x11 driver doesn't support scaling, and it can't change screen resolution.
   Yes, I know that it should be but I have no time to write software
   scaling routines and experiencing with XVidMode extension...
   You can do it yourself, just press ALT,CTRL,- or ALT,CTRL,+ simultaneously,
   see X-server docs for details.

Q: audio goes out of sync playing .avi file
A: try with -bps or -nobps option
   if still bad, send me (upload to ftp) that file, I'll check.

Q: what is the meaning of numbers in the status line?
A: see:
     A:   2.1  V:   2.2  A-V: -0.167  ct:  0.042   57  41%   0%  2.6% 0
   - A: audio position in seconds
   - V: video position in seconds
   - A-V: audio-video difference in seconds (delay)
   - ct: total A-V sync correction done
   - frames played (counting from last seek)
   - video codec cpu usage in percent (for mpeg it includes video_out too!)
   - video_out cpu usage for avi, 0 for mpg (see above)
   - audio codec cpu usage in percent
   - dropped bad frames (mpg only)
   Most of them are for debug purposes, and will be removed soon.

Q: Why is video_out cpu usage zero (0%) for mpeg files?
A: It's not zero, but it's built in into codec, so can't be measured separated.
   You should try to play the file using -vo null and then -vo ... and check
   the difference to see video_out speed...

Q: OpenGL (-vo gl) output doesn't work (hangup/black window/X11 errors)
A: your opengl driver doesn't support dynamic texture chanegs (glTexSubImage)
   it's known not to work with X 4.0.x DRI drivers and nVidia's binary shit.
   it's known to work with Utah-GLX and Matrox G400 card.
   it will not work with 3DFX cards because the 256x256 texture size limit.

Q: I have G200/G400, how to compile/use mga_vid driver?
A: read INSTALL and README...

Q: What's XMMP? (it's XMMS or XMPS but mispelled?)
A: It's a new project, see http://frozenproductions.com for details

Q: There are error messages about file not found /usr/lib/win32/....
A: Download & install w32codec.zip from *our* FTP
   (avifile's codec package has different DLL set)

Q: It wants to load l3codeca.acm, but I don't have such file.
A: You should use w32codec.zip from MPlayer FTP instead of avifile's pack!

Q: ...... works with avifile/aviplay while doesn't with MPlayer
A: MPlayer != avifile
   The only common thing between these players is the Win32 DLL loader.
   The codecs (dll) sets, syncronization, demultiplexing etc is totaly
   different and shouldn't be compared.
   If something works with aviplay it doesn't mean that MPlayer should do
   it and vice versa. You should contact me, I'll fix the bug!

Q: Indeo 3.x/4.x movies are viewed upside-down!!!?
A: It's a known bug (really it's a bug/limitation of the DLL codec)

Q: Indeo 3.x,4.x video doesn't work at 32bpp resolutions (16,24 bpp are ok)
A: It's a known bug (really it's a bug/limitation of the DLL codec)

Q: I've got 'MPlayer interrupted by signal 11' in module audio_setup or
   decode_audio.
A: It's a damaged file with bad mp3 audio stream. Try it with  -afm 4

Q: It aborts with signal 11 playing a file with IMA-ADPCM audio.
A: This codec isn't yet supported!

Q: Are there rpm/deb/... packages of MPlayer?
A: Not yet. However, you can make a .deb package for yourself, check
   DOCS/DEBIAN

Q: Are there any mailing lists on MPlayer?
A: Yes! See README on how to subscribe them!

Q: I've found a nasty bug when I tried to play my favourite video!!
   Who should I inform?
A: Inform the MPlayer-users mailing list about your problem. *ALWAYS*
   read the README about what information we NEED to identify your problem.
   Use the developers addresses (specified in AUTHORS) only if you want to
   flame, or want to ask for a date. ;)

Q: During 'make', MPlayer complains about X11 libraries. I don't understand,
   I DO have X installed!?
A: ...but you don't have the X development package installed. It's called
   XFree86-devel* under RedHat, and xlib6g-dev* under Debian.
   Also check if the /usr/X11 symlink exists (this can be a problem on
   Mandrake systems). It can be created with the 'ln -sf /usr/X11R6 /usr/X11'
   command. Your distribution may differ from the Linux Filesystem Standard.

Q: I have problems playing files with ... codec. Can I use'em?
A: Check DOCS/TODO , if it doesn't contain your codec, contact us.
