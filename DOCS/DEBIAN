To build the package:
 Get the cvs version, or .tgz and uncompress it,
 cd into programs directory:
eyck@incubus:~/src$ cd main
eyck@incubus:~/src/main$ fakeroot debian/rules binary
 (... mplayer detects hardware/software, builds itself and.. )
 ..
 dpkg-deb: building package `mplayer' in `../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb'.

And now just dpkg -i ../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb as root.
Here's how it looks like:

eyck@incubus:/src/main$ sudo dpkg -i ../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb
