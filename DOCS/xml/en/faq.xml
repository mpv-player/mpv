Why don't you use autoconf/automake?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
We have a modular, handwritten build system. It does a reasonably good

.. gcc 2.96 ... (Yes, some people are STILL flaming about gcc 2.96!)
</para></question>
<answer><para>
Quoted from a <ulink url="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-users/2001-October/005351.html">mail</ulink>
A'rpi sent to the <ulink url="http://mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-users/">mplayer-users</ulink>
list (the word 'ideg' is described below):
<blockquote>
<para>
And we have idegs. And our idegcounter overflowed again and again.
</para>
<para>
Unfortunately <application>MPlayer</application> is out of our control.
It's used by lamers, Linux users who can't even use Windows, and never
tried to compile a kernel. They installed (with default options) Mandrake
or Red Hat or SuSE, and without RTFM'ing they send messages saying
'it doesn't work! help me! please! i'm new to Linux! help! oh! help me!'.
We can't stop them, but at least we try to force them to RTFM and to read
the messages of ./configure and <application>MPlayer</application>.
</para>
<para>
And you clever guys come and flame us with gcc 2.96 and binary packages.
Instead of helping users or making patches to help solve problems.
</para>
<para>
Half of our spare/free time is spent by answering silly mails here and
making newer tricks and checks to configure to avoid such mails.
</para>
<para>
And there is a balance. On the one side are you, clever guys, saying we
are very bad because we don't like buggy gcc 2.96, and on the other side
there are the 'new to Linux' guys who are showing us gcc 2.96 is buggy.
</para>
<para>
Conclusion: We can't be good. Half the people will always say we are bad.
</para>
<para>
Maybe we should close the project, make it closed source, commercial, and
provide install support for it. then we could leave current work, so development
could go faster, and we could earn lots of money with it and buy a big house,
etc etc. Do you really want it? It seems.

During 'make', <application>MPlayer</application> complains about X11 libraries.
I don't understand, I DO have X installed!?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
... but you don't have the X development package installed. Or not correctly.
It's called <filename>XFree86-devel*</filename> under Red Hat, and
<filename>xlibs-dev</filename> under Debian. Also check if the
<filename class="directory">/usr/X11</filename> and
<filename class="directory">/usr/include/X11</filename> symlinks exist (this
can be a problem on Mandrake systems). They can be created with these commands:
<screen>
     # ln -sf /usr/X11R6 /usr/X11
     # ln -sf /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11

The <option>-xy</option> or <option>-fs</option> option doesn't work with
the x11 driver (<option>-vo x11</option>) ...
</para></question>
<answer><para>
It does, but you have to explicitly specify software scaling (very slow) with the
<option>-zoom</option> option. You better use XF86VidMode support: You must
specify the <option>-vm</option> and the <option>-fs</option> option, and you're
done. Make sure you have the right modelines in your <filename>XF86Config</filename>
file, and try to make the <link linkend="dga">DGA driver</link> and
<link linkend="sdl">SDL's DGA driver</link> work for you. It's much
faster. If SDL's DGA works, use that, it'll be even faster.

<qandaentry>
<question><para>
Why is video_out CPU usage zero (0%) for some files?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
It's not zero, but it's called from the codec and thus cannot be measured
separately. You should try to play the file using <option>-vo null</option> and
then <option>-vo ...</option> and check the difference to see the video_out speed.
</para></answer>
<answer><para>
You are using Direct Rendering, where the codec renders to the video memory
itself. In this case, the decoding percentage contains the display percentage, too.

Do you have a stray <filename>codecs.conf</filename> file in
<filename>~/.mplayer/</filename>, <filename>/etc/</filename>,
<filename>/usr/local/etc/</filename> or a similar location? Remove it,
outdated <filename>codecs.conf</filename> files can cause obscure
problems. <application>MPlayer</application> will use its built-in one instead.

<question><para>
Why doesn't <application>MPlayer</application> work on Fedora Core?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
There is a bad interaction on Fedora between exec-shield,
prelink, and any applications which use Windows DLLs
(such as <application>MPlayer</application>).
</para>
<para>
The problem is that exec-shield randomizes the load addresses of all the
system libraries. This randomization happens at prelink time (once every
two weeks).
</para>
<para>
When <application>MPlayer</application> tries to load a Windows DLL it
wants to put it at a specific address (0x400000). If an important system
library happens to be there already, <application>MPlayer</application>
will crash.
(A typical symptom would be a segmentation fault when trying
to play Windows Media 9 files.)
</para>

If you run into this problem you have two options:

Check <command>ldd /usr/local/bin/mplayer</command> output. If it contains
<screen>libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4???????)</screen>
where &quot;?&quot; is any number then it's OK, the error is not here. If it is:
<screen>libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00??????)</screen>
then there is a problem with your kernel/libc. Maybe you are using some security
patches (for example Solar Designer's OpenWall patch) which forces loading
libraries to very low addresses. Because <filename>l3codeca.acm</filename> is a
non-relocatable DLL, it must be loaded to <literal>0x00400000</literal>, we can't
