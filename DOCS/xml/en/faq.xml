Unfortunately MPlayer is out of our control. It's used by lamers, Linux
users who can't even use Windows, and never tried to compile a kernel. They
installed (with default options) Mandrake or Red Hat or SuSE, and without
RTFM'ing they send messages saying 'it doesn't work! help me! please! i'm
new to Linux! help! oh! help me!'. We can't stop them, but at least we try
to force them to RTFM and to read the messages of ./configure and MPlayer.

<para>
And you clever guys come and flame us with gcc 2.96 and binary packages.
Instead of helping users or making patches to help solve problems.

<para>
Half of our spare/free time is spent by answering silly mails here and
making newer tricks and checks to configure to avoid such mails.
</para>
<para>
And there is a balance. On the one side are you, clever guys, saying we
are very bad because we don't like buggy gcc 2.96, and on the other side
there are the 'new to Linux' guys who are showing us gcc 2.96 is buggy.
</para>
<para>
Conclusion: We can't be good. Half the people will always say we are bad.
</para>
<para>
Maybe we should close the project, make it closed source, commercial, and
provide install support for it. then we could leave current work, so development
could go faster, and we could earn lots of money with it and buy a big house,
etc etc. Do you really want it? It seems.

<answer><para>
... but you don't have the X development package installed. Or not correctly.
It's called <filename>XFree86-devel*</filename> under Red Hat, and
<filename>xlibs-dev</filename> under Debian. Also check if the
<filename class="directory">/usr/X11</filename> and
<filename class="directory">/usr/include/X11</filename> symlinks exist (this
can be a problem on Mandrake systems). They can be created with these commands:

Can I run multiple instances of MPlayer?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
Yes. Some video out drivers like xv, dga or (x)mga are exclusive, some are
exclusive in combination with certain graphics boards and drivers. You will
not be able to run more than one instance of MPlayer with one of those video
out drivers. To a lesser degree this also applies to audio drivers. Not all
allow playback of multiple streams on the same device.

It does, but you have to explicitly specify software scaling (very slow) with the
<option>-zoom</option> option. You better use XF86VidMode support: You must
specify the <option>-vm</option> and the <option>-fs</option> option, and you're
done. Make sure you have the right modelines in your <filename>XF86Config</filename>
file, and try to make the <link linkend="dga">DGA driver</link> and
<link linkend="sdl">SDL's DGA driver</link> work for you. It's much
faster. If SDL's DGA works, use that, it'll be even faster.

Why is video_out cpu usage zero (0%) for some files?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
It's not zero, but it's called from the codec and thus cannot be measured
separately. You should try to play the file using <option>-vo null</option> and
then <option>-vo ...</option> and check the difference to see the video_out speed.
</para></answer>
<answer><para>
You are using Direct Rendering, where the codec renders to the video memory
itself. In this case, the decoding percentage contains the display percentage, too.

patches (for example Solar Designer's OpenWall patch) which forces loading

It works only if running as root! It's a DGA limitation. You should become root

root, but it's not recommended!
