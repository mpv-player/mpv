<title>Setting up MTRR</title>

<para>
It is VERY recommended to check if the MTRR registers
are set up properly, because they can give a big performance boost.
</para>

<para>
Do a <command>cat /proc/mtrr</command>:
<screen>
<prompt>--($:~)--</prompt> cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0xe4000000 (3648MB), size=  16MB: write-combining, count=9
reg01: base=0xd8000000 (3456MB), size= 128MB: write-combining, count=1<!--
--></screen>
</para>

<para>
It's right, shows my Matrox G400 with 16MB memory. I did this from
XFree 4.x.x, which sets up MTRR registers automatically.
</para>

<para>
If nothing worked, you have to do it manually. First, you have to find the
base address. You have 3 ways to find it:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
  from X11 startup messages, for example:
  <screen>
(--) SVGA: PCI: Matrox MGA G400 AGP rev 4, Memory @ 0xd8000000, 0xd4000000
(--) SVGA: Linear framebuffer at 0xD8000000<!--
  --></screen>
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  from <filename>/proc/pci</filename> (use <command>lspci -v</command>
  command):
  <screen>
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc.: Unknown device 0525
Memory at d8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable)<!--
  --></screen>
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  from mga_vid kernel driver messages (use <command>dmesg</command>):
  <screen>mga_mem_base = d8000000</screen>
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
Then let's find the memory size. This is very easy, just convert video RAM
size to hexadecimal, or use this table:
<informaltable frame="none">
<tgroup cols="2">
<tbody>
  <row><entry>1 MB</entry><entry>0x100000</entry></row>
  <row><entry>2 MB</entry><entry>0x200000</entry></row>
  <row><entry>4 MB</entry><entry>0x400000</entry></row>
  <row><entry>8 MB</entry><entry>0x800000</entry></row>
  <row><entry>16 MB</entry><entry>0x1000000</entry></row>
  <row><entry>32 MB</entry><entry>0x2000000</entry></row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</informaltable>
</para>

<para>
You know base address and memory size, let's setup MTRR registers!
For example, for the Matrox card above (<literal>base=0xd8000000</literal>)
with 32MB ram (<literal>size=0x2000000</literal>) just execute:
<screen>
echo "base=0xd8000000 size=0x2000000 type=write-combining" &gt; /proc/mtrr
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Not all CPUs have MTRRs. For example older K6-2 (around 266MHz,
stepping 0) CPUs don't have MTRRs, but stepping 12 does
(execute <command>cat /proc/cpuinfo</command> to check it).
</para>

Under XFree86 4.0.2 or newer, you can use your card's hardware YUV routines
using the XVideo extension. This is what the option

brightness/contrast/hue/etc. (unless you use the old, slow DirectShow DivX
codec, which supports it everywhere), see the man page.

<sect2 id="tdfx">
<title>3dfx cards</title>

<para>
Older 3dfx drivers were known to have problems with XVideo acceleration, it
didn't support YUY2 or YV12 colorspaces. Verify that you have XFree86
version 4.2.0 or later, it can handle YV12 and YUY2 while previous
versions, including 4.1.0, <emphasis role="bold">crash with YV12</emphasis>.
If you experience strange effects using <option>-vo xv</option>, try SDL

<sect2 id="s3">
<title>S3 cards</title>

<para>
S3 Savage3D's should work fine, but for Savage4, use XFree86 version 4.0.3
or greater (in case of image problems, try 16bpp). As for S3 Virge: there is
xv support, but the card itself is very slow, so you better sell it.
</para>

<para>
There is now a native framebuffer driver for S3 Virge cards similar to
tdfxfb. Set up your framebuffer (e.g. append
"<option>vga=792 video=vesa:mtrr</option>" to your kernel command line) and use
<option>-vo s3fb</option> (<option>-vf yuy2</option> and <option>-dr</option>
will also help).

<note><para>
It's currently unclear which Savage models lack YV12 support, and convert by

<para>
nVidia isn't always a very good choice under Linux ... XFree86's

<sect1 id="dga">
<title>DGA</title>

<formalpara>
<title>PREAMBLE</title>
<para>
This document tries to explain in some words what DGA is in general and
what the DGA video output driver for <application>MPlayer</application>
can do (and what it can't).
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
<title>WHAT IS DGA</title>
<para>
<acronym>DGA</acronym> is short for <emphasis>Direct Graphics
Access</emphasis> and is a means for a program to bypass the X server and
directly modifying the framebuffer memory. Technically spoken this happens
by mapping the framebuffer memory into the memory range of your process.
This is allowed by the kernel only if you have superuser privileges. You
can get these either by logging in as <systemitem
class="username">root</systemitem> or by setting the SUID bit on the
<application>MPlayer</application> executable (<emphasis role="bold">not
recommended</emphasis>).
</para>
</formalpara>
<para>
There are two versions of DGA: DGA1 is used by XFree 3.x.x and DGA2 was
introduced with XFree 4.0.1.
</para>

<para>
DGA1 provides only direct framebuffer access as described above. For
switching the resolution of the video signal you have to rely on the
XVidMode extension.
</para>

<para>
DGA2 incorporates the features of XVidMode extension and also allows
switching the depth of the display. So you may, although basically
running a 32 bit depth X server, switch to a depth of 15 bits and vice
versa.
</para>

<para>
However DGA has some drawbacks. It seems it is somewhat dependent on the
graphics chip you use and on the implementation of the X server's video
driver that controls this chip. So it does not work on every system...
</para>

<formalpara>
<title>INSTALLING DGA SUPPORT FOR MPLAYER</title>

<para>
First make sure X loads the DGA extension, see in
<filename>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</filename>:

<programlisting>(II) Loading extension XFree86-DGA</programlisting>

See, XFree86 4.0.x or greater is
<emphasis role="bold">highly recommended</emphasis>!
<application>MPlayer</application>'s DGA driver is autodetected by
<filename>./configure</filename>, or you can force it
with <option>--enable-dga</option>.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
If the driver couldn't switch to a smaller resolution, experiment with
options <option>-vm</option> (only with X 3.3.x), <option>-fs</option>,
<option>-bpp</option>, <option>-zoom</option> to find a video mode that
the movie fits in. There is no converter right now :(
</para>

<para>
Become <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>. DGA needs root
access to be able to write directly video memory. If you want to run it as
user, then install <application>MPlayer</application> SUID root:

<screen>
chown root <replaceable>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</replaceable>
chmod 750 <replaceable>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</replaceable>
chmod +s <replaceable>/usr/local/bin/mplayer</replaceable>
</screen>

Now it works as a simple user, too.
</para>

<caution>
<title>Security risk</title>
<para>
This is a <emphasis role="bold">big</emphasis> security risk!
<emphasis role="bold">Never</emphasis> do this on a server or on a computer
that can be accessed by other people because they can gain root privileges
through SUID root <application>MPlayer</application>.
</para>
</caution>

<para>
Now use <option>-vo dga</option> option, and there you go! (hope so:) You
should also try if the <option>-vo sdl:driver=dga</option> option works for you!
It's much faster!
</para>


<formalpara id="dga-modelines">
<title>RESOLUTION SWITCHING</title>

<para>
The DGA driver allows for switching the resolution of the output signal.
This avoids the need for doing (slow) software scaling and at the same time
provides a fullscreen image. Ideally it would switch to the exact
resolution (except for honoring aspect ratio) of the video data, but the X
server only allows switching to resolutions predefined in
<filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename>
(<filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</filename> for XFree 4.X.X respectively).
Those are defined by so-called modelines and depend on
the capabilities of your video hardware. The X server scans this config
file on startup and disables the modelines not suitable for your hardware.
You can find out which modes survive with the X11 log file. It can be found
at: <filename>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</filename>.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
These entries are known to work fine with a Riva128 chip, using the nv.o X
server driver module.

<formalpara>
<title>DGA &amp; MPLAYER</title>
<para>
DGA is used in two places with <application>MPlayer</application>: The SDL
driver can be made to make use of it (<option>-vo sdl:driver=dga</option>) and
within the DGA driver (<option>-vo dga</option>). The above said is true
for both; in the following sections I'll explain how the DGA driver for
<application>MPlayer</application> works.
</para>
</formalpara>


<formalpara>
<title>FEATURES</title>

<para>
The DGA driver is invoked by specifying <option>-vo dga</option> at the
command line. The default behavior is to switch to a resolution matching
the original resolution of the video as close as possible. It deliberately
ignores the <option>-vm</option> and <option>-fs</option> options
(enabling of video mode switching and fullscreen) - it always tries to
cover as much area of your screen as possible by switching the video mode,
thus refraining from using additional cycles of your CPU to scale the
image. If you don't like the mode it chooses you may force it to choose
the mode matching closest the resolution you specify by <option>-x</option>
and <option>-y</option>. By providing the <option>-v</option> option, the
DGA driver will print, among a lot of other things, a list of all
resolutions supported by your current <filename>XF86Config</filename> file.
Having DGA2 you may also force it to use a certain depth by using the
<option>-bpp</option> option. Valid depths are 15, 16, 24 and 32. It
depends on your hardware whether these depths are natively supported or if
a (possibly slow) conversion has to be done.
</para>
</formalpara>
<para>
If you should be lucky enough to have enough offscreen memory left to
put a whole image there, the DGA driver will use double buffering, which
results in much smoother movie playback. It will tell you whether
double buffering is enabled or not.
</para>

<para>
Double buffering means that the next frame of your video is being drawn in
some offscreen memory while the current frame is being displayed. When the
next frame is ready, the graphics chip is just told the location in memory
of the new frame and simply fetches the data to be displayed from there.
In the meantime the other buffer in memory will be filled again with new
video data.
</para>

<para>
Double buffering may be switched on by using the option
<option>-double</option> and may be disabled with
<option>-nodouble</option>. Current default option is to disable
double buffering. When using the DGA driver, onscreen display (OSD) only
works with double buffering enabled. However, enabling double buffering may
result in a big speed penalty (on my K6-II+ 525 it used an additional 20%
of CPU time!) depending on the implementation of DGA for your hardware.
</para>


<formalpara>
<title>SPEED ISSUES</title>

<para>
Generally spoken, DGA framebuffer access should be at least as fast as
using the X11 driver with the additional benefit of getting a fullscreen
image. The percentage speed values printed by
<application>MPlayer</application> have to be interpreted with some care,
as for example, with the X11 driver they do not include the time used by
the X server needed for the actual drawing. Hook a terminal to a serial
line of your box and start <command>top</command> to see what is really
going on in your box.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
Generally spoken, the speedup done by using DGA against 'normal' use of X11
highly depends on your graphics card and how well the X server module for it
is optimized.
</para>

<para>
If you have a slow system, better use 15 or 16 bit depth since they require
only half the memory bandwidth of a 32 bit display.
</para>

<para>
Using a depth of 24 bit is a good idea even if your card natively just supports
32 bit depth since it transfers 25% less data compared to the 32/32 mode.
</para>

<para>
I've seen some AVI files be played back on a Pentium MMX 266. AMD K6-2
CPUs might work at 400 MHZ and above.
</para>


<formalpara>
<title>KNOWN BUGS</title>

<para>
Well, according to some developers of XFree, DGA is quite a beast. They
tell you better not to use it. Its implementation is not always flawless
with every chipset driver for XFree out there.

<sect1 id="sdl">
<title>SDL</title>

<para>
<acronym>SDL</acronym> (Simple Directmedia Layer) is basically a unified
video/audio interface. Programs that use it know only about SDL, and not
about what video or audio driver does SDL actually use. For example a Doom
port using SDL can run on svgalib, aalib, X, fbdev, and others, you only
have to specify the (for example) video driver to use with the
<envar>SDL_VIDEODRIVER</envar> environment variable. Well, in theory.
</para>

<para>
With <application>MPlayer</application>, we used its X11 driver's software
scaler ability for cards/drivers that doesn't support XVideo, until we made
our own (faster, nicer) software scaler. Also we used its aalib output, but
now we have ours which is more comfortable. Its DGA mode was better than
ours, until recently. Get it now? :)
</para>

<para>
It also helps with some buggy drivers/cards if the video is jerky (not slow
system problem), or audio is lagging.
</para>

<para>
SDL video output supports displaying subtitles under the movie, on the (if
present) black bar.

Be sure not to use the <option>-fs</option> switch, since it toggles the

This driver was designed and introduced as a <emphasis role="bold">generic

BIOS. Another advantage of this driver is that it tries to force TV output

<citetitle>VESA BIOS EXTENSION (VBE) Version 3.0 Date: September 16,
1998</citetitle> (Page 70) says:
</para>

<blockquote>
<formalpara><title>Dual-Controller Designs</title>
<para>
VBE 3.0 supports the dual-controller design by assuming that since both
controllers are typically provided by the same OEM, under control of a
single BIOS ROM on the same graphics card, it is possible to hide the fact
that two controllers are indeed present from the application. This has the
limitation of preventing simultaneous use of the independent controllers,
but allows applications released before VBE 3.0 to operate normally. The
VBE Function 00h (Return Controller Information) returns the combined
information of both controllers, including the combined list of available
modes. When the application selects a mode, the appropriate controller is
activated. Each of the remaining VBE functions then operates on the active
controller.

<listitem><para>
  You can use standalone video output driver: <option>-vo xvidix</option>.
  This driver was developed as X11's front end to VIDIX technology. It
  requires X server and can work only under X server. Note that, as it directly
  accesses the hardware and circumvents the X driver, pixmaps cached in the
  graphics card's memory may be corrupted. You can prevent this by limiting
  the amount of video memory used by X with the XF86Config option "VideoRam"
  in the device section. You should set this to the amount of memory installed
  on your card minus 4MB. If you have less than 8MB of video ram, you can use
  the option "XaaNoPixmapCache" in the screen section instead.
</para></listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
  There is a console VIDIX driver: <option>-vo cvidix</option>.
  This requires a working and initialized framebuffer for most cards (or else
  you'll just mess up the screen), and you'll have a similar effect as with
  <option>-vo mga</option> or <option>-vo fbdev</option>. nVidia cards however
  are able to output truly graphical video on a real text console. See the
  <link linkend="vidix-nvidia">nvidia_vid</link> section for more information.
  To get rid of text on the borders and the blinking cursor, try something like
  </para>

  <screen>setterm -cursor off > /dev/tty9</screen>

  <para>
  (assuming <systemitem>tty9</systemitem> is unused so far) and then
  switch to <systemitem>tty9</systemitem>.
  On the other hand, <option>-colorkey 0</option> should give you a video
  running in the "background", though this depends on the colorkey
  functionality to work right.

<title>REQUIREMENTS</title>
<listitem><para>
  Video card should be in graphics mode (except nVidia cards with the
  <option>-vo cvidix</option> output driver).
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  <application>MPlayer</application>'s video output driver should know

</itemizedlist>

<formalpara><title>USAGE METHODS</title>
<para>
When VIDIX is used as <emphasis role="bold">subdevice</emphasis> (<option>-vo
vesa:vidix</option>) then video mode configuration is performed by video
output device (<emphasis role="bold">vo_server</emphasis> in short). Therefore you can
pass into command line of <application>MPlayer</application> the same keys
as for vo_server. In addition it understands <option>-double</option> key
as globally visible parameter. (I recommend using this key with VIDIX at
least for ATI's card). As for <option>-vo xvidix</option>, currently it
recognizes the following options: <option>-fs -zoom -x -y -double</option>.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
Also you can specify VIDIX's driver directly as third subargument in
command line:
<screen>
mplayer -vo xvidix:mga_vid.so -fs -zoom -double <replaceable>file.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
or
<screen>
mplayer -vo vesa:vidix:radeon_vid.so -fs -zoom -double -bpp 32 <replaceable>file.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
But it's dangerous, and you shouldn't do that. In this case given driver
will be forced and result is unpredictable (it may
<emphasis role="bold">freeze</emphasis> your computer). You should do that
ONLY if you are absolutely sure it will work, and
<application>MPlayer</application> doesn't do it automatically. Please tell
about it to the developers. The right way is to use VIDIX without arguments
to enable driver autodetection.

If you want to do software transcoding you should have at least a 1GHz CPU.

Then compile and install as usual.</para>

<formalpara><title>USAGE</title>
<para>
Hardware decoding of streams containing MPEG-1/2 video and/or MPEG audio can be done with this
command:
<screen>
mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes <replaceable>file.mpg|vob</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
Decoding of any other type of video stream requires transcoding to MPEG-1, thus it's slow
and may not be worth the trouble, especially if your computer is slow.
It can be achieved using a command like this:
<screen>
mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes <replaceable>yourfile.ext</replaceable>
mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf expand <replaceable>yourfile.ext</replaceable>
</screen></para>

<para>
Note that DVB cards only support heights 288 and 576 for PAL or 240 and 480 for
NTSC. You <emphasis role="bold">must</emphasis> rescale for other heights by
adding <option>scale=width:height</option> with the width and height you want
to the <option>-vf</option> option. DVB cards accept various widths, like 720,
704, 640, 512, 480, 352 etc. and do hardware scaling in horizontal direction,
so you do not need to scale horizontally in most cases.
For a 512x384 (aspect 4:3) MPEG-4 (DivX) try:
<screen>mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf scale=512:576</screen>
</para>

<para>
If you have a widescreen movie and you do not want to scale it to full height,
you can use the <option>expand=w:h</option> filter to add black bands. To view a
640x384 MPEG-4 (DivX), try:
<screen>
mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf expand=640:576 <replaceable>file.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If your CPU is too slow for a full size 720x576 MPEG-4 (DivX), try downscaling:
<screen>
mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf scale=352:576 <replaceable>file.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>

<para>If speed does not improve, try vertical downscaling, too:
<screen>
mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vf scale=352:288 <replaceable>file.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
For OSD and subtitles use the OSD feature of the expand filter. So, instead of
<option>expand=w:h</option> or <option>expand=w:h:x:y</option>, use
<option>expand=w:h:x:y:1</option> (the 5th parameter <option>:1</option>
at the end will enable OSD rendering). You may want to move the image up a bit
to get a bigger black zone for subtitles. You may also want to move subtitles
up, if they are outside your TV screen, use the
<option>-subpos &lt;0-100&gt;</option>
option to adjust this (<option>-subpos 80</option> is a good choice).
</para>

<para>
In order to play non-25fps movies on a PAL TV or with a slow CPU, add the
<option>-framedrop</option> option.
</para>

<para>
To keep the aspect ratio of MPEG-4 (DivX) files and get the optimal scaling
parameters (hardware horizontal scaling and software vertical scaling
while keeping the right aspect ratio), use the new dvbscale filter:
<screen>
for a  4:3 TV: -vf dvbscale,scale=-1:0,expand=-1:576:-1:-1:1
for a 16:9 TV: -vf dvbscale=1024,scale=-1:0,expand=-1:576:-1:-1:1

</para>

<para>
In your audio and video fields you can use an extended syntax:
<option>...:pid[+pid]:...</option> (for a maximum of 6 pids each);
in this case <application>MPlayer</application> will include in the
stream all the indicated pids, plus pid 0 (that contains the PAT).
You should always include in each row the PMT and PCR pids for the
corresponding channel (if you know them).
You can also specify 8192, this will select all pids on this frequency
and you can then switch between the programs with TAB.
This might need more bandwidth, though cheap cards always transfer all
channels at least to the kernel so it does not make much of a difference
for these.
Other possible uses are: televideo pid, second audio track, etc.
</para>

<para>
If <application>MPlayer</application> complains frequently about
<screen>Too many video/audio packets in the buffer</screen> or
if you notice a growing desynchronization between audio and
video verify the presence of the PCR pid in your stream
(needed to comply with the buffering model of the transmitter)
and/or try to use the libavformat MPEG-TS demuxer by adding
<option>-demuxer lavf -lavfdopts probesize=128</option>
to your command line.

<title>USAGE</title>
<varlistentry>
<term><option>-vo dxr3:prebuf:sync:norm=x:<replaceable>device</replaceable></option></term>
<listitem><para>
<option>overlay</option> activates the overlay instead of TV-out. It requires
that you have a properly configured overlay setup to work right. The easiest
way to configure the overlay is to first run autocal. Then run mplayer with
dxr3 output and without overlay turned on, run dxr3view. In dxr3view you can
tweak the overlay settings and see the effects in realtime, perhaps this feature
will be supported by the <application>MPlayer</application> GUI in the future.
When overlay is properly set up you will no longer need to use dxr3view.
<option>prebuf</option> turns on prebuffering. Prebuffering is a feature of the
em8300 chip that enables it to hold more than one frame of video at a time.
This means that when you are running with prebuffering
<application>MPlayer</application> will try to keep the video buffer filled
with data at all times.
If you are on a slow machine <application>MPlayer</application> will probably
use close to, or precisely 100% of CPU.
This is especially common if you play pure MPEG streams
(like DVDs, SVCDs a.s.o.) since <application>MPlayer</application> will not have
to reencode it to MPEG it will fill the buffer very fast.
With prebuffering video playback is <emphasis role="bold">much</emphasis>
less sensitive to other programs hogging the CPU, it will not drop frames unless
applications hog the CPU for a long time.
When running without prebuffering the em8300 is much more sensitive to CPU load,
so it is highly suggested that you turn on <application>MPlayer</application>'s
<option>-framedrop</option> option to avoid further loss of sync.
<option>sync</option> will turn on the new sync-engine. This is currently an
experimental feature. With the sync feature turned on the em8300's internal
clock will be monitored at all times, if it starts to deviate from
<application>MPlayer</application>'s clock it will be reset causing the em8300
to drop any frames that are lagging behind.
<option>norm=x</option> will set the TV norm of the DXR3 card without the need
for external tools like em8300setup. Valid norms are 5 = NTSC, 4 = PAL-60,
3 = PAL. Special norms are 2 (auto-adjust using PAL/PAL-60) and 1 (auto-adjust
using PAL/NTSC) because they decide which norm to use by looking at the frame
rate of the movie. norm = 0 (default) does not change the current norm.
<option><replaceable>device</replaceable></option> = device number to use if
you have more than one em8300 card. Any of these options may be left out.
<option>:prebuf:sync</option> seems to work great when playing MPEG-4 (DivX)
movies. People have reported problems using the prebuf option when playing
MPEG-1/2 files.
You might want to try running without any options first, if you have sync
problems, or DVD subtitle problems, give <option>:sync</option> a try.

  See the man page for further info about <option>-vf lavc</option>.
  Currently there is no way of setting the fps of the em8300 which means that
  it is fixed to 30000/1001 fps.
  Because of this it is highly recommended that you use
  <option>-vf lavc=<replaceable>quality</replaceable>:25</option>
  especially if you are using prebuffering. Then why 25 and not 30000/1001?
  Well, the thing is that when you use 30000/1001 the picture becomes a bit
  jumpy.
  The reason for this is unknown to us.
  If you set it to somewhere between 25 and 27 the picture becomes stable.
  For now all we can do is accept this for a fact.

  convert the input video to MPEG-4 (this is mandatory, sorry), then apply an

<sect1 id="other">
<title>Other visualization hardware</title>

<sect2 id="zr">
<title>Zr</title>

<para>
This is a display-driver (<option>-vo zr</option>) for a number of MJPEG
capture/playback cards (tested for DC10+ and Buz, and it should work for the
LML33, the DC10). The driver works by encoding the frame to JPEG and then
sending it to the card. For the JPEG encoding
<systemitem class="library">libavcodec</systemitem>
is used, and required. With the special <emphasis>cinerama</emphasis> mode,
you can watch movies in true wide screen provided that you have two beamers
and two MJPEG cards. Depending on resolution and quality settings, this driver
may require a lot of CPU power, remember to specify <option>-framedrop</option>
if your machine is too slow. Note: My AMD K6-2 350MHz is (with
<option>-framedrop</option>) quite adequate for watching VCD sized material and
downscaled movies.
</para>

<para>
This driver talks to the kernel driver available at
<ulink url="http://mjpeg.sf.net"/>, so
you must get it working first. The presence of an MJPEG card is autodetected by
the <filename>configure</filename> script, if autodetection fails, force
detection with
<screen>./configure --enable-zr</screen>
</para>

<para>
The output can be controlled by several options, a long description of the
options can be found in the man page, a short list of options can be viewed
by running
<screen>mplayer -zrhelp</screen>
</para>

<para>
Things like scaling and the OSD (on screen display) are not handled by
this driver but can be done using the video filters. For example, suppose
that you have a movie with a resolution of 512x272 and you want to view it
fullscreen on your DC10+. There are three main possibilities, you may scale
the movie to a width of 768, 384 or 192. For performance and quality reasons,
I would choose to scale the movie to 384x204 using the fast bilinear software
scaler. The command line is
<screen>
mplayer -vo zr -sws 0 -vf scale=384:204 <replaceable>movie.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Cropping can be done by the <option>crop</option> filter and by this
driver itself. Suppose that a movie is too wide for display on your Buz and
that you want to use <option>-zrcrop</option> to make the movie less wide,
then you would issue the following command
<screen>
mplayer -vo zr -zrcrop 720x320+80+0 <replaceable>benhur.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
if you want to use the <option>crop</option> filter, you would do
<screen>
mplayer -vo zr -vf crop=720:320:80:0 <replaceable>benhur.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Extra occurrences of <option>-zrcrop</option> invoke
<emphasis>cinerama</emphasis> mode, i.e. you can distribute the movie over
several TVs or beamers to create a larger screen.
Suppose you have two beamers. The left one is connected to your
Buz at <filename>/dev/video1</filename> and the right one is connected to
your DC10+ at <filename>/dev/video0</filename>. The movie has a resolution
of 704x288. Suppose also that you want the right beamer in black and white and
that the left beamer should have JPEG frames at quality 10, then you would
issue the following command
<screen>
mplayer -vo zr -zrdev /dev/video0 -zrcrop 352x288+352+0 -zrxdoff 0 -zrbw \
    -zrcrop 352x288+0+0 -zrdev /dev/video1 -zrquality 10 \
	<replaceable>movie.avi</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
You see that the options appearing before the second <option>-zrcrop</option>
only apply to the DC10+ and that the options after the second
<option>-zrcrop</option> apply to the Buz. The maximum number of MJPEG cards
participating in <emphasis>cinerama</emphasis> is four, so you can build a
2x2 vidiwall.
</para>

<para>
Finally an important remark: Do not start or stop XawTV on the playback device
during playback, it will crash your computer. It is, however, fine to
<emphasis role="bold">FIRST</emphasis> start XawTV,
<emphasis role="bold">THEN</emphasis> start <application>MPlayer</application>,
wait for <application>MPlayer</application>
to finish and <emphasis role="bold">THEN</emphasis> stop XawTV.

TV output support for these cards has only been recently introduced, and is

Currently the <emphasis role="bold">mga_vid</emphasis> module can't be used
AFAIK, because the G450/G550 driver works only in one configuration: the first

The first CRTC can't be routed to the second head currently. The author of the
