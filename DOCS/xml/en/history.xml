<blockquote><para>
This began a year ago...  I have tried lots of players under Linux
(<application>mtv</application>, <application>xmps</application>,
<application>dvdview</application>, <application>livid/oms</application>,
<application>videolan</application>, <application>xine</application>,
<application>xanim</application>, <application>avifile</application>,
<application>xmmp</application>) but they all have some problem. Mostly with
special files or with audio/video sync. Most of them are unable to play both
MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and AVI (DivX) files. Many players have image quality or speed
problems too. So I've decided to write/modify one...
