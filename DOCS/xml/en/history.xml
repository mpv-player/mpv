This began a year ago...  I (A'rpi) have tried lots of players under linux
(mtv, xmps, dvdview, livid/oms, videolan, xine, xanim, avifile, xmmp) but
they all have some problem. Mostly with special files or with audio/video
sync.  Most of them is unable to play both MPEG1, MPEG2 and AVI (DivX)
files. Many players have image quality or speed problems too. So I've
decided to write/modify one...
