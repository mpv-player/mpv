<title>How to read this documentation</title>

<para>
If you are a first-time installer: be sure to read everything from here to
the end of the Installation section, and follow the links you will find. If
you have any other questions, return to the <link linkend="toc">Table of
Contents</link> and search for the topic, read the <xref linkend="faq"/>,
or try grepping through the files.
</para>

<para>
The main rule of this documentation: if it's not documented, it
<emphasis>does not exist.</emphasis> If I don't say you encode audio from
TV tuner, you can't.  A healthy quantity of combining ability is welcomed,
though.  Good luck. You'll need it :) And for another good advice, let me
quote Chris Phillips from the
<ulink url="http://mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-users/">mplayer-users</ulink>
mailing list:
</para>

<blockquote><para>
I said a while ago that there is such a difference between a newbie and a
dumbass. No matter what you actually know about a system (linux, cars,
girls :D) you should ALWAYS be able to take a step back and be objective,
otherwise, you're just dumb IMHO. A girl I live with assumed the vacuum
cleaner was broken because it didn't suck things up. never thought to
change the bag, because she'd never done it before... now that's just
stupid, not a case of simply not knowing what to do... Simply not being
that familiar with your surroundings is no excuse for a) laziness and b)
ignorance. So many people seem to see the word "error" and then stop...
few seem to actually read the words on the OTHER side of the colon.

<chapter id="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
<application>MPlayer</application> is a movie player for Linux (runs on
many other Unices, and <emphasis role="bold">non-x86</emphasis> CPUs, see
<xref linkend="ports"/>). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, OGG/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV,
QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, PVA files, supported by
many native, XAnim, RealPlayer, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch
<emphasis role="bold">VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, RealMedia</emphasis>, and
<emphasis role="bold">DivX</emphasis> movies too (and you don't need the avifile
library at all!). Another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of
supported output drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib,
fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB, but you can use GGI and SDL (and this way all their
drivers) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and
Radeon, Mach64, Permedia3) too! Most of them supports software or hardware
scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
<application>MPlayer</application> supports displaying through some
hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the <link linkend="dvb">DVB</link> and
<link linkend="dxr3">DXR3/Hollywood+</link>. And what about the nice big
antialiased shaded subtitles (<emphasis role="bold">10 supported types</emphasis>)
with European/ISO 8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic, Korean
fonts, and the onscreen display (OSD)?
</para>

<para>
The player is rock solid playing damaged MPEG files (useful for some VCDs),
and it plays bad AVI files which are unplayable with the famous windows
media player. Even AVI files without index chunk are playable, and you can
temporarily rebuild their indexes with the <option>-idx</option> option, or
permanently with <application>MEncoder</application>, thus enabling
seeking!  As you see, stability and quality are the most important things,
but the speed is also amazing.
</para>

<para>
<application>MEncoder</application> (MPlayer's Movie Encoder) is a simple movie
encoder, designed to encode MPlayer-playable movies
(<emphasis role="bold">AVI/ASF/OGG/DVD/VCD/VOB/MPG/MOV/VIV/FLI/RM/NUV/NET/PVA</emphasis>)
to other MPlayer-playable formats (see below). It can encode with various codecs,
like <emphasis role="bold">DivX4</emphasis> (1 or 2 passes), libavcodec,
<emphasis role="bold">PCM/MP3/VBR MP3</emphasis> audio. Also has powerful plugin
system for video manipulation.
