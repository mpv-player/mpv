The documentation and its translations reside in subdirectories.
When building the documentation, the toplevel Makefile goes into
the subdirectories listed in the SUBDIRS variable and executes make
in each of those directories to create the HTML documentation
in subdirectories of the 'HTML' directory.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT place sensitive files under 'HTML'!
	   It is for generated documentation only.
	   The whole directory tree is wiped out by the Makefile
	   when running 'make distclean' or 'make clean'.
	   Also, subdirectories are wiped out one by one before
	   creating the HTML files.

Each subdirectory must have a Makefile.  Its purpose is to include
the toplevel Makefile.inc file (with the rules to build the docs)
and add dependency information to the main target, $(HTMLDIR)/index.html.
The main target usually depends on all the XML and XSL files in the
subdirectory.  (Note that the toplevel *.xsl files are added automatically
by Makefile.inc, so you do not have to list them.)


Adding new translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Create a new subdirectory and copy the XML files there. main.xml must not be
   copied, it is autogenerated.

2) Make sure to create a 'Makefile' for the translation -- you can
   use 'en/Makefile' as an example.

3) If you want to use a customized XSL stylesheet, create one and name it
   'html-common.xsl'. Also create two additional XSL stylesheets
   ('html-single.xsl' and 'html-chunk.xsl'), with content such as this:

   html-single.xsl:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
   <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                version="1.0">

  <xsl:import href="../html-single.xsl"/>
  <xsl:include href="html-common.xsl"/>

  </xsl:stylesheet>

  html-chunk.xsl:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
  <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                version="1.0">

  <xsl:import href="../html-chunk.xsl"/>
  <xsl:include href="html-common.xsl"/>

  </xsl:stylesheet>


   Note: You mustn't xsl:include or xsl:import chunk.xsl directly!
   Including it can (and will) break building of documentation if chunk.xsl
   is installed at a nonstandard location.

4) If you wish to change the output encoding of generated files, create
   html-common.xsl as suggested in step 4) and add strings such as these
   somewhere between the <xsl:stylesheet ...> and </xsl:stylesheet> tags
   (please, pay attention to quotes):

      <xsl:param name="chunker.output.encoding" select="'your_encoding'"/>
      <xsl:output encoding="your_encoding"/>

5) In each translated file after the <?xml ... ?> tag you must put a note
   like <!-- synced with r2 -->, where 2 is the revision of corresponding
   English file (see comment at the top of file).

That's all, in theory.
