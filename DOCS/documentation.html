  <A NAME=1>1.  Introduction


  <A NAME=1.1>1.1.  Overview

  <B>MPlayer</B> is a movie player for LINUX. It plays most MPEG, AVI and ASF files,
  supported by many native and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and
  even DivX movies too. The another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of
  supported output drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,
  but you can use SDL (and this way all drivers of SDL, for example AAlib) and
  some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for Matrox) too! Most of them supports
  software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen. And what
  about the nice big antialiased shaded subtitles (7 supported types!!!) with
  hungarian, english, cyrillic, czech, korean fonts, and OSD?

  I didn't write any codecs, just some players. I spent
  a lot of time finding the best way to parse bad damaged input files
  (both MPEG and AVI) and to do perfect A-V sync with seeking ability.
  My player is rock solid playing damaged MPEG files (useful for some VCDs),
  and it plays bad AVI files which are unplayable with the famous
  windows media player. Even AVI files without index chunk are playable, and
  you can rebuild their indexes with the -idx option, thus enabling seeking!
  As you see, stability and quality are the most important things for me,
  but the speed is also amazing.


  <A NAME=1.2>1.2.  History

  This began a year ago...
  I've tried lots of players under linux (mtv,xmps,dvdview,livid/oms,VideoLAN,
  xine,xanim,avifile,xmmp) but they all have some problem. Mostly with special
  files or with audio/video sync. Most of them is unable to play both MPEG1,
  MPEG2 and AVI (DivX) files. Many players have image quality or speed problems
  too. So I've decided to write/modify one...

  - mpg12play v0.1-v0.3:
    The first try, hacked together in a half hour!
    I've used libmpeg3 from www.heroinewarrior.com up to the version 0.3,
    but there were image quality and speed problems with it.
  - mpg12play v0.5-v0.87:
    Mpeg codec replaced with DVDview by Dirk Farin, it was a great stuff,
    but it was slow and was written in C++ (I hate C++!!!)
  - mpg12play v0.9-v0.95pre5:
    Mpeg codec was libmpeg2 (mpeg2dec) by Aaron Holtzman & Michel Lespinasse.
    It's great, optimized very fast C code with perfect image quality and
    100% MPEG standard conformance.
  - <B>MPlayer</B> v0.3-v0.9:
    It was a pack of two programs: mpg12playv0.95pre6 and my new simple AVI
    player 'avip' based on avifile's Win32 DLL loader.
  - <B>MPlayer</B> v0.10:
    The MPEG and AVI player in a single binary!
  - <B>MPlayer</B> v0.11:
    Some new developers joined and from 0.11 the mplayer project is a team-work!
    Added .ASF file support, and OpenDivX (see www.projectmayo.com) en/decoding.
  - <B>MPlayer</B> v0.17 "The IdegCounter"
    The release version of the 0.11pre after 4 months of heavy development!
    Try it, and be amazed! Thousands of new features added... and of course
    old code was improved too, bugs removed etc.
  - <B>MPlayer</B> 0.18 "The BugCounter"
    2 months since 0.17 and here's a new release.. Completed ASF support,
    more subtitle formats, introduced libao (similar to libvo but to audio),
    even more stable than ever, and so on. It's a MUST !  


  <A NAME=1.3>1.3.  Installation

  If you plan to use <B>MPlayer</B> on x86 architecture, you possibly want to use
  Win32 codecs. Download and unzip w32codecs.zip to /usr/lib/win32 .
  Note: the avifile project has similar codecs package, but it differs
  from our, so if you want to use all supported codecs, then use
  our package! However, you can use our codecs package with avifile.

  If you own a Matrox G200/G400/G450 card, then please see the <A HREF="#2.2.1.6">2.2.1.6</A>
  section in order to gain big speedup. It is important to do these steps
  _before_ compiling <B>MPlayer</B>, otherwise no Matrox-specific support will be
  built.

  Then build <B>MPlayer</B>:


	./configure
	make
	make install


  It is recommended to browse the output of ./configure , it contains info
  about what will be built, and what won't. You may also want to view
  config.h and config.mak files.

  Though not mandatory, the fonts should be installed in order to gain
  OSD, and subtitle functionality. Download mp_font3.zip (and optional
  language updates) and optional (if exists) language updates.


	mkdir ~/.mplayer/font
	cd ~/.mplayer/font
	unzip mp_font3.zip
	unzip mp_font3_hu.zip


  <A NAME=1.4>1.4.  What about the GUI ?

  I'm not a GUI programmer. I hate GUIs, I like the pure black 80x25 console.
  So the player has only keyboard control from the controlling console/xterm now.
  There is a GUI development for the player, coordinated by Pontscho/Fresh!
  It's still under development, but it will be merged and released real soon.
  BTW he needs some nice skins, if you are a good graphician, contact him!!!


  <A NAME=2>2.  Features


  <A NAME=2.1>2.1.  Video Formats, Audio & Video Codecs


  <A NAME=2.1.1>2.1.1.  Supported input formats

  <B>MPlayer</B> can read/play from the following devices/formats:
   - VCD (Video CD) directly from CD-ROM or from CDRwin's .bin image file     
   - DVD, directly from your DVD disk, using optional libcss for decryption
   - MPEG 1/2 System Stream (PS/PES/VOB) and Elementary Stream (ES) file
     formats
   - RIFF AVI file format
   - ASF 1.0 file format
   - supports reading from file, stdin, DVD drive or network via HTTP

  Note: about quicktime (.mov/.qt) and realmedia (.ra/.rm) support read the FAQ!


  <A NAME=2.1.2>2.1.2.  Supported audio & video codecs

  See http://mplayer.sourceforge.net/DOCS/codecs.html for the complete,
  daily updated list!!!

  The most important video codecs:
  - MPEG1 (VCD) and MPEG2 (DVD) video
  - DivX, OpenDivX and other MPEG4 variants
  - Windows Media Video 7 (WMV1) used in .wmv files
  - Intel Indeo codecs (3.1,3.2,4.1,5.0)
  - MJPEG, ASV2 and other hardware formats

  The most important audio codecs:
  - MPEG layer 2, and layer 3 (MP3) audio (native code, with 3dnow optimization)
  - AC3 dolby audio (native code, with 3dnow optimization)
  - Voxware audio
  - alaw, msgsm, pcm and other simple old audio formats

  If you have a codec not listed here, and not supported yet, just
  read http://mplayer.sourceforge.net/DOCS/codecs.html
  to get info about its status and about how to help us adding support for it!


  <A NAME=2.1.2.1>2.1.2.1.  OpenDivX

  This section contains information about the DivX/OpenDivX codecs of
  <A HREF="http://www.projectmayo.com">ProjectMayo</A>. Their first available alpha version was the OpenDivX 4.0
  alpha 47 and 48. Support for this was/is included in <B>MPlayer</B>, and built by
  default. We even used its postprocessing code to optionally enhance visual
  quality of MPEG1/2 movies.

  The new generation of this codec can even decode movies made with the
  infamous DivX codec! And it's not everything, it's MUCH faster than the
  traditional Win32 DivX DLL's. See below for configuration. The only
  disadvantage of this codec is that it's currently closed-source. :(

  The codec can be downloaded from the following URL:


    http://download2.projectmayo.com/dnload/divx4linux/divx4linux-20010718.zip


  No automatic installing available at this time, so install it manually,
  EXACTLY as described here. Unpack it, and copy files to their place:


  cp libdivxdecore.so.0.0.0 /usr/local/lib/
  ln -s /usr/local/lib/libdivxdecore.so.0.0.0 /usr/local/lib/libdivxdecore.so.0
  ln -s /usr/local/lib/libdivxdecore.so.0 /usr/local/lib/libdivxdecore.so
  ldconfig
  cp decore.h /usr/local/include/


  At the moment <B>MPlayer</B> doesn't contain autodetection for the codec, so you'll
  have to edit config.h and config.mak manually. But first run ./configure .
  Change #undef NEW_DECORE to #define NEW_DECORE in config.h
  Change #define MPEG12_POSTPROC to #undef MPEG12_POSTPROC in config.h
  Change DECORE_LIBS in config.mak to be:


	DECORE_LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib -ldivxdecore


  Continue compiling <B>MPlayer</B> as usual.

  Using it is a bit tricky. As it conflicts with the old OpenDivX (it's API is
  very similar to OpenDivX's), OpenDivX code is disabled, and the OpenDivX
  driver calls this library too.

  Generally we can pinpoint this issue to that you have two options to use
  this codec:


	-vc odivx : using divx4 codec as a new version of OpenDivX.
		    in this case it produces YV12 image in its own buffer,
		    and <B>MPlayer</B> (libvo) does colorspace conversion.

	-vc divx4 : using divx4 codec's colorspace conversion.
		    in this mode, you can use YUY2/UYVY too.

  The 'odivx' method is usually faster, due to the fact that it transfers
  image data in YV12 (planar YUV 4:2:0) format, thus requiring much less
  bandwidth on the bus. For packed YUV modes (YUY2, UYVY) use the 'divx4'
  method. For RGB modes you can choose freely, their speed is same, maybe
  differ according to the current bpp.

  Note: it supports postprocessing too, but range of values is strange:

	0		no postproc
	10 .. 20	postprocessing, normal
			(like level 2 with divxds)
	30 .. 60	hard postprocessing, eats many CPU.
			(like level 4 with divxds)


  <A NAME=2.1.2.2>2.1.2.2.  ffmpeg's DivX/libavcodec

  Beginning with version 0.4.2 , <A HREF="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net">ffmpeg</A> contains an <B>opensource</B> DivX codec,
  which is compatible with the traditional DivX. <B>MPlayer</B> contains this codec,
  and this makes it possible to <B>watch DivX movies on non-x86 platforms!</B>
  To get it compile, you'll need nasm, bison, and flex, above the other
  devel tools. No manual hacking is needed to build it, ./configure detects
  if it can be built. At the moment it doesn't support postprocessing, and
  is under optimization (it's generally a bit faster than the DirectShow
  DivX codec, now).

  In order to use it, refresh your codecs.conf file, and do as the manpage,
  or the example.conf says (the -vfm option).

  Note: libavcodec contains other codecs as well, but at the moment we mostly
        focus on ffdivx.

  <A NAME=2.1.3>2.1.4.  Codec importing howto


  <A NAME=2.1.4.1>2.1.4.1.  VFW codecs

  VfW (Video for Windows) is the old Video API for Windows. Its codecs have
  the .DLL or (rarely) .DRV extension.
  If <B>MPlayer</B> fails with your AVI:


        UNKNOWN video codec: HFYU (0x55594648)


  It means your AVI is encoded with a codec which has the HFYU fourcc (HFYU =
  HuffYUV codec, DIV3 = DivX Low Motion, etc...). Now that we know this, we'll
  have to find out which DLL Windows loads in order to play this file. In our
  case, the system.ini contains this (with many others):


	VIDC.HFYU=huffyuv.dll


  So we'll need the huffyuv.dll file. Note that the audio codecs are specified
  with the MSACM prefix :


	msacm.l3acm=L3codeca.acm


  This is the MP3 codec.
  So, now we have all the info needed (fourcc, codec file, sample AVI), submit
  your codec support request in mail, and upload these files to the FTP:
    ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/<codecname>/


  <A NAME=2.1.4.2>2.1.4.2.  DirectShow codecs

  DirectShow is the newer Video API, which is even worse than its predecessor.
  Things are harder with DirectShow, since
   - system.ini doesn't contain the needed information, instead it's stored in
     the registry :(
   - we'll need the GUID of the codec.

    So let's search that goddamn registry..
   - Start 'regedit'
   - press ctrl-f, disable the first two checkbox, and enable the third. Type
  the fourcc of the codec. (for ex.: TM20)
   - you should see a field which contains the path and filename
     (for ex. : C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TM20DEC.AX)
   - now that we have the file, we'll need the GUID. Try searching again, but
  now we'll search for the codec's name, not the fourcc. Its name can be acquired
  when Media Player is playing that file, by checking File/Properties/Advanced.
  If not, bad luck ;) Try guessing.
     (for ex. search for : TrueMotion)
   - if found (in registry), there should be a FriendlyName field, and a CLSID
  field. Write down that 16 byte of CLSID, this is the GUID required by us.


  NOTE : if searching fails, try to enable all the checkboxes.. you may have
         false hits, but maybe you'll have the right, too...
  NOTE : dump that M$ shit.


  So, now we have all the info needed (fourcc, GUID, codec file, sample AVI),
  submit your codec support request in mail, and upload these files to the FTP:
      ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/<codecname>/


  <A NAME=2.2>2.2.  Video & Audio output devices


  <A NAME=2.2.1>2.2.1.  Video output devices   

  General:
  - x11:  X11 with optional SHM extension
  - xv:   X11 using overlays with the Xvideo extension (hardware YUV & scaling)
  - gl:   OpenGL renderer, so far works only with :
          - all cards with Utah-GLX
          - Matrox cards with X/DRI >=4.0.3
          - Radeon with X/DRI CVS
  - dga:  X11 DGA extension
  - fbdev:Output to general framebuffers
  - svga: Output to SVGAlib
  - sdl:  1.1.7 : supports software scaling
          1.1.8 : supports Xvideo (hardware scaling/fullscreen)
          1.2.0 : supports aalib (textmode rendering, very funny!)
  - ggi: similar to SDL

  Card specific:
  - mga:  Matrox G200/G400 hardware YUV overlay via the mga_vid device
  - xmga: Matrox G200/G400 overlay (mga_vid) in X11 window
          (Xv emulation on X 3.3.x !)
  - syncfb: Matrox G400 YUV support on framebuffer (obsoleted, use mga/xmga)
  - 3dfx: Voodoo2/3 hardware YUV (/dev/3dfx) support (not yet tested, maybe
          broken)

  Special:
  - png:  PNG files output (use -z switch to set compression)
  - pgm:  PGM files output (for testing purposes or ffmpeg encoding)
  - md5:  MD5sum output (for MPEG conformance tests)
  - odivx:OpenDivX AVI File writer (use -br to set encoding bitrate)
  - null: Null output (for speed tests/benchmarking)

  NOTE: check the following subsections for details and requirements!


  <A NAME=2.2.1.1>2.2.1.1.  Xv

  Under XFree86 4.0.2 or newer, you can use your card's hardware YUV routines
  using the XVideo extension. This is what the option '-vo xv' uses.
  In order to make this work, be sure to check the following:
   - You have to use XFree86 4.0.2 or newer (former versions don't have XVideo)
   - Your card actually supports harware acceleration (modern cards do)
   - X loads the XVideo extension, it's something like this:


	(II) Loading extension XVideo


     in /var/log/XFree86.0.log


     NOTE : this loads only the XFree86's extension. In a good install, this is
            always loaded, and doesn't mean that the _card's_ XVideo support is
            loaded!

   - Your card has Xv support under Linux. To check, try 'xvinfo', it is the
     part of the XFree86 distribution. It should display a long text, similar
     to this:


	X-Video Extension version 2.2
	screen #0
	  Adaptor #0: "Savage Streams Engine"
	    number of ports: 1
	    port base: 43
	    operations supported: PutImage 
	    supported visuals:
	      depth 16, visualID 0x22
	      depth 16, visualID 0x23
	    number of attributes: 5
	(...)
	    Number of image formats: 7
	      id: 0x32595559 (YUY2)
	        guid: 59555932-0000-0010-8000-00aa00389b71
	        bits per pixel: 16
	        number of planes: 1
	        type: YUV (packed)
	      id: 0x32315659 (YV12)
	        guid: 59563132-0000-0010-8000-00aa00389b71
	        bits per pixel: 12
	        number of planes: 3
	        type: YUV (planar)
	(...etc...)


     It must support YUY2 packed, and YV12 planar pixel formats to be
     usable with <B>MPlayer</B>.

   - And finally, check if <B>MPlayer</B> was compiled with 'xv' support.
     ./configure prints this.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.1.1>2.2.1.1.1.  3dfx cards

  Older 3dfx drivers were known to have problems with XVideo acceleration,
  it didn't support either YUY2 or YV12, and so. Verify that you have
  XFree86 version 4.1.0 or greater, it works ok. Alternatively, you can use
  <A HREF="http://dri.sourceforge.net">DRI</A> cvs.
  If you experience strange effects using -vo xv, try SDL (it has XVideo too)
  and see if it helps. Check the <A HREF="#2.2.1.3">SDL section</A> for details.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.1.2>2.2.1.1.2.  S3 cards

  S3 Savage3D's should work fine, but for Savage4, use XFree86 version 4.0.3
  or greater. As for S3 Virge.. sell it.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.1.3>2.2.1.1.3.  nVidia cards

  nVidia isn't a very good choice under Linux.. You'll have to use the
  binary nVidia driver, available at nVidia's website. The standard X
  driver doesn't support XVideo for these cards, due to nVidia's closed
  sources/specifications.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.1.4>2.2.1.1.4.  ATI cards

  The GATOS driver has VSYNC enabled by default. It means that decoding speed
  (!) is synced to the monitor's refresh rate. If playing seems to be slow, try
  disabling VSYNC somehow, or set refresh rate to n*(fps of the movie) Hz.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.2>2.2.1.2.  DGA

  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.1>2.2.1.2.1.  Summary

  This document tries to explain in some words what DGA is in general and
  what the DGA video output driver for mplayer can do (and what it can't).


  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.2>2.2.1.2.2.  What is DGA

  DGA is short for Direct Graphics Access and is a means for a program to
  bypass the X-Server and directly modifying the framebuffer memory. 
  Technically spoken this happens by mapping the framebuffer memory into
  the memory range of your process. This is allowed by the kernel only
  if you have superuser privileges. You can get these either by logging in 
  as root or by setting the suid bit on the mplayer excecutable (NOT
  recommended!).

  There are two versions of DGA: DGA1 is used by XFree 3.x.x and DGA2 was 
  introduced with XFree 4.0.1.

  DGA1 provides only direct framebuffer access as described above. For 
  switching the resolution of the video signal you have to rely on the 
  XVidMode extension.

  DGA2 incorporates the features of XVidMode extension and also allows
  switching the depth of the display. So you may, although basically 
  running a 32 bit depth XServer, switch to a depth of 15 bits and vice 
  versa. 

  However DGA has some drawbacks. It seems it is somewhat dependent on the
  graphics chip you use and on the implementation of the XServer's video 
  driver that controls this chip. So it does not work on every system ...


<A NAME=2.2.1.2.3>2.2.1.2.3.  Installing DGA support for <B>MPlayer</B>

  First make sure X loads the DGA extension, see in /var/log/XFree86.0.log :


		(II) Loading extension XFree86-DGA


  See, XFree86 4.0.x or greater is VERY RECOMMENDED!
  <B>MPlayer</B>'s DGA driver is autodetected on ./configure, or you can force it
  with --enable-dga.

  If the driver couldn't switch to a smaller resolution, experiment with
  switches -vm (only with X 3.3.x), -fs, -bpp, -zoom to find a video mode that
  the movie fits in. There is no converter right now.. :(

  Become ROOT. DGA needs root access to be able to write directly video memory.
  If you want to run it as user, then install <B>MPlayer</B> SUID root:


		chown root /usr/local/bin/mplayer
		chmod 750 /usr/local/bin/mplayer 
		chmod +s /usr/local/bin/mplayer


  Now it works as a simple user, too.


                         !!!! BUT STAY TUNED !!!!
    This is a BIG security risk! Never do this on a server or on a computer
   can be accessed by more people than only you because they can gain root
                    privilegies through suid root mplayer.
                      !!!! SO YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ... !!!!


  Now use '-vo dga' option, and there you go! (hope so:)
  You should also try if the '-vo sdl:dga' option works for you! It's much
  faster!!!


  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.4>2.2.1.2.4.  Resolution switching

  The DGA driver allows for switching the resolution of the output signal.
  This avoids the need for doing (slow) software scaling and at the same
  time provides a fullscreen image. Ideally it would switch to the exact
  resolution (except for honouring aspect ratio) of the video data, but the
  XServer only allows switching to resolutions predefined in 
  /etc/X11/XF86Config (/etc/X11/XF86Config-4 for XFree 4.0.X respectively).
  Those are defined by so-called modelines and depend on the capabilites
  of your video hardware. The XServer scans this config file on startup and
  disables the modelines not suitable for your hardware. You can find 
  out which modes survive with the X11 log file. It can be found at:
  /var/log/XFree86.0.log
  See appendix A for some sample modeline definitions.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.5>2.2.1.2.5.  DGA & <B>MPlayer</B>       

  DGA is used in two places with <B>MPlayer</B>: The SDL driver can be made to make
  use of it (-vo sdl:dga) and within the DGA driver (-vo dga).
  The above said is true for both; in the following sections I'll explain
  how the DGA driver for <B>MPlayer</B> works.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.6>2.2.1.2.6.  Features of the DGA driver
 
  The DGA driver is invoked by specifying -vo dga at the command line.
  The default behaviour is to switch to a resolution matching the original 
  resolution of the video as close as possible. It deliberately ignores the 
  -vm and -fs switches (enabling of video mode switching and fullscreen) - 
  it always tries to cover as much area of your screen as possible by switching
  the video mode, thus refraining to use a single additional cycle of your CPU 
  to scale the image.
  If you don't like the mode it chooses you may force it to choose the mode
  matching closest the resolution you specify by -x and -y. 
  By providing the -v option, the DGA driver will print, among a lot of other 
  things, a list of all resolutions supported by your current XF86-Config 
  file.
  Having DGA2 you may also force it to use a certain depth by using the -bpp 
  option. Valid depths are 15, 16, 24 and 32. It depends on your hardware 
  whether these depths are natively supported or if a (possibly slow) 
  conversion has to be done.
 
  If you should be lucky enough to have enough offscreen memory left to 
  put a whole image there, the DGA driver will use doublebuffering, which 
  results in much smoother movie replaying. It will tell you whether double-
  buffering is enabled or not.

  Doublebuffering means that the next frame of your video is being drawn in
  some offscreen memory while the current frame is being displayed. When the
  next frame is ready, the graphics chip is just told the location in memory 
  of the new frame and simply fetches the data to be displayed from there.
  In the meantime the other buffer in memory will be filled again with new 
  video data.

  Doublebuffering may be switched on by using the option -double and may be 
  disabled with -nodouble. Current default option is to disable 
  doublebuffering. When using the DGA driver, onscreen display (OSD) only 
  works with doublebuffering enabled. However, enabling doublebuffering may
  result in a big speed penalty (on my K6-II+ 525 it used an additional 20% of
  CPU time!) depending on the implementation of DGA for your hardware. 
 

  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.7>2.2.1.2.7.  Speed issues

  Generally spoken, DGA framebuffer access should be at least as fast as using
  the X11 driver with the additional benefit of getting a fullscreen image.
  The percentage speed values printed by mplayer have to be interpreted with 
  some care, as for example, with the X11 driver they do not include the time
  used by the X-Server needed for the actual drawing. Hook a terminal to a 
  serial line of your box and start top to see what is really going on in your 
  box ...

  Generally spoken, the speedup done by using DGA against 'normal' use of X11 
  highly depends on your graphics card and how well the X-Server module for it 
  is optimized.

  If you have a slow system, better use 15 or 16bit depth since they require 
  only half the memory bandwidth of a 32 bit display. 
 
  Using a depth of 24bit is even a good idea if your card natively just supports 
  32 bit depth since it transfers 25% less data compared to the 32/32 mode. 
 
  I've seen some avi files already be replayed on a Pentium MMX 266. AMD K6-2
  CPUs might work at 400 MHZ and above.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.8>2.2.1.2.8.  Known bugs

  Well, according to some developpers of XFree, DGA is quite a beast. They 
  tell you better not to use it. Its implementation is not always flawless
  with every chipset driver for XFree out there.

  o with XFree 4.0.3 and nv.o there is a bug resulting in strange colors
  o ATI driver requires to switch mode back more than once after finishing 
    using of DGA
  o some drivers simply fail to switch back to normal resolution (use 
    Ctrl-Alt-Keypad +, - to switch back manually)
  o some drivers simply display strange colors
  o some drivers lie about the amount of memory they map into the process's
    address space, thus vo_dga won't use doublebuffering (SIS?)
  o some drivers seem to fail to report even a single valid mode. In this
    case the DGA driver will crash telling you about a nonsense mode of 
    100000x100000 or the like ...
  o OSD only works with doublebuffering enabled


  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.9>2.2.1.2.9.  Future work

  o use of the new X11 render interface for OSD
  o where is my TODO list ???? :-(((

  <A NAME=2.2.1.2.B>2.2.1.2.B.  Bug Reports

  If you experience troubles with the DGA driver please feel free to file 
  a bug report to me (e-mail address below). Please start mplayer with the 
  -v option and include all lines in the bug report that start with vo_dga:
 
  Please do also include the version of X11 you are using, the graphics card 
  and your CPU type. The X11 driver module (defined in XF86-Config) might 
  also help. Thanks!

  <A NAME=2.2.1.3>2.2.1.3.  SDL

  Here are some notes about SDL out in <B>MPlayer</B>.

  There are several commandline switches for SDL:

		-vo sdl:name	specifies sdl video driver to use (ie. aalib,
				dga, x11)
		-ao sdl:name	specifies sdl audio driver to use (ie. dsp,
				esd)
		-noxv		disables Xvideo hardware acceleration
		-forcexv	tries to force Xvideo acceleration

  SDL Keys:

		F toggles fullscreen/windowed mode
		C cycles available fullscreen modes
		W/S mappings for * and / (mixer control)

  KNOWN BUGS:
  - Keys pressed under aalib console driver repeat forever.
    It's bug in SDL, I can't change it (tested with SDL 1.2.1).


  <A NAME=2.2.1.4>2.2.1.4.  SVGAlib

  If you don't have X, you can use the SVGAlib target! Be sure not to use the
  -fs switch, since it toggles the usage of the software scaler, and it's
  SLOOOW now, unless you have a real fast CPU (and/or MTRR?). :(

  Of course you'll have to install svgalib and its development package in
  order for <B>MPlayer</B> build its SVGAlib driver (autodetected, but can be
  forced), and don't forget to edit /etc/vga/libvga.config to suit your
  card & monitor.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.5>2.2.1.5.  Framebuffer output (FBdev)

  Whether to build the FBdev target is autodetected during ./configure .
  Read the framebuffer documentation in the kernel sources
  (Documentation/fb/*) for info on how to enable it, etc.. !

  If your card doesn't support VBE 2.0 standard (older ISA/PCI
  cards, such as S3 Trio64), only VBE 1.2 (or older?) :
  Well, VESAfb is still available, but you'll have to load SciTech Display
  Doctor (formerly UniVBE) before booting Linux.  Use a DOS boot disk or
  whatever.  And don't forget to register your UniVBE ;))


  NOTE: FBdev video mode changing _does not work_ with the VESA framebuffer,
	and don't ask for it, since it's not an <B>MPlayer</B> limitation.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.6>2.2.1.6.  Matrox framebuffer (mga_vid)

  This section is about the Matrox G200/G400/G450 BES (Back-End Scaler)
  support, the mga_vid kernel driver.  It's active developed by me (A'rpi), and
  it has hardware VSYNC support with triple buffering. It works on both
  framebuffer console and under X.
  
  To use it, you first have to compile mga_vid.o :


		cd drivers
		make


  Then create /dev/mga_vid device :


		mknod /dev/mga_vid c 178 0


  and load the driver with


		insmod mga_vid.o


  You should verify the memory size detection using the 'dmesg' command. If
  it's bad, use the mga_ram_size option (rmmod mga_vid first), specify card's
  memory size in MB:


		insmod mga_vid.o mga_ram_size=16


  To make it load/unload automatically when needed, insert the following line
  at the end of /etc/modules.conf :


		alias char-major-178 mga_vid


  Then run


		depmod -a


  Now you have to (re)compile <B>MPlayer</B>, ./configure will detect /dev/mga_vid
  and build the 'mga' driver. Using it from <B>MPlayer</B> goes by '-vo mga' if
  you have matroxfb console, or '-vo xmga' under XFree86 3.x.x or 4.x.x .

  Note: '-vo xmga' works under XFree86 4.x.x, but it conflicts with the Xv
  driver, so avoid using both. If you messed up Xv with mga, try running
  <B>MPlayer</B> with '-vo mga' . It should fix Xv.
  

  <A NAME=2.2.1.7>2.2.1.7.  SiS 6326 framebuffer (sis_vid)

  SiS 6326 YUV Framebuffer driver -> sis_vid kernel driver

  Its interface should be compatible with the mga_vid, but the driver was not
  updated after the mga_vid changes, so it's outdated now.  Volunteers
  needed to test it and bring the code up-to-date.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.8>2.2.1.8.  3dfx YUV support

  3dfx has native YUV+scaler support, using /dev/3dfx (tdfx.o driver?)
  The /dev/3dfx kernel driver exists only for 2.2.x kernels, for use with
  Glide 2.x Linux ports. It's not tested with <B>MPlayer</B>, and so no more
  supported. Volunteers needed to test it and bring the code up-to-date.


  <A NAME=2.2.1.9>2.2.1.9.  OpenGL output

  <B>MPlayer</B> support displaying movies using OpenGL. Unfortunately, not all
  drivers support this ability. For example the Utah-GLX drivers
  (for XFree86 3.3.6) have it, with all cards.
  See <A HREF="http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net">http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net</A> for details about how to install it.

  XFree86(DRI) >= 4.0.3 supports it only with Matrox, and Radeon cards.
  See <A HREF="http://dri.sourceforge.net">http://dri.sourceforge.net</A> for download, and installation instructions.

  Linux Infrared Remote Control - use an easy to build home-brewn IR-receiver, 
  an (almost) arbitrary remote control and control your linux box with it!
  More about it at www.lirc.org.

  If you have installed the lirc-package, you can compile <B>MPlayer</B> with LIRC
  support using  ./configure --enable-lirc

  If everything went fine, <B>MPlayer</B> will print a message like 
    LIRC init was successful.
  on startup. If an error occurs it will tell you. If it doens't tell you 
  anything about LIRC there's no support compiled in. That's it :-)

  The application name for <B>MPlayer</B> is - oh wonder - mplayer_lirc.
  It understands the following commands:

  PAUSE  - pause playing. Any other keystroke will continue replay.
  QUIT   - exit mplayer
  RWND   - 10 secs back
  FRWND  - 60 secs back
  FWD    - skip 10 secs
  FFWD   - skip 60 secs
  INCVOL - increase volume one percent
  DECVOL - decrease volmue one percent
  MASTER - use master mixer channel
  PCM    - use pcm mixer channel

  Don't forget to enable the repeat flag for RWND/FWD in .lircrc. Here's an
  excerpt from my .lircrc:

  begin
   remote = CU-SX070
   prog = mplayer_lirc
   button = Tape_Play
   repeat = 1
   config = FFWD
  end

  begin
   remote = CU-SX070
   prog = mplayer_lirc
   button = Tape_Stop
   config = QUIT
  end

  If you don't like the standard location for the lirc-config file (~/.lircrc) 
  use the -lircconf <filename> switch to specify another file.


  <A NAME=3.3>3.3.  Streaming from network or pipes

  <B>MPlayer</B> can read from stdin (NOT named pipes). This can be for example
  used to play from FTP :

  <A NAME=4>4.  TV-out support


  <A NAME=4.1>4.1.  Matrox cards

  > windows box. When I start a movie in windows (in a window or in full screen)
  > the movie is also redirected to the tv-out and I can also see it full screen

  It's a driver limitation. BES (Back-End Scaler, it's the overlay generator
  and YUV scaling engine of G200/G400/G450 cards) works only with CRTC1.
  Normally, CRTC1 (textmode, every bpp gfx and BES) is routed to HEAD1,
  and CRTC2 (only 16/32bpp gfx) is routed to HEAD2 (TV-out).

  Under linux, you have two choices to get TV-out working:

  1. Using X 4.0.x + the HAL driver from matrox, so you'll get dual-head
     support, and you'll be able to redirect second output to the TV.
     Unfortunately it has Macrovision encryption enabled, so it will
     only work on directly-connected TV, no through VCR.
     Other problem is that Xv doesn't work on the second head.
     (I don't know how Windows solve it, maybe it swaps the CRTCs between
     the heads, or just uses YUV framebuffer of second DAC with some trick)

  2. Using matroxfb with dual-head support enabled (2.4.x kernels).
     You'll be able to get a framebuffer console (using CRTC2, so it's
     slow), and TV-out (using CRTC1, with BES support).
     You have to forget X while using this kind of TV-out! :(

  -  Compile all the matrox-related things to modules in the kernel.
     (you MUST compile them to modules, at least I couldn't get them
     working built-in yet)
     [reboot to new kernel & install modules, but don't load them yet!]

    cd TVout  
    ./compile.sh

  -  Run the 'modules' script from the TV-out directory of mplayer.
     It will switch your console to framebuffer.
     Change to tty1 (ALT+F1)!
     Now run the script 'independent', it will set up your tty's:
       tty 1,2:      fb console, CRTC2, head 1 (monitor)
       tty 3,4,5...: framebuffer+BES, CRTC1, head 2 (TV-out)
     You should run the scripts TV-* and Mon-* to set up resolutions:
       change to tty1 (ALT+F1), and run Mon-* (one of them)
       change to tty3 (ALT+F3) and then back to tty1 (ALT+F1)
         (this change will select tty3 on /dev/fb1 - tricky)
       run TV-* (one of them)
         (now you'll get a console on your PAL TV - don't know about NTSC)

     Now if you start mplayer (on tty1), the picture will show up on
     the tty3, so you'll see it on your TV or second monitor.

  Yes, it is a bit 'hack' now. But I'm waiting for the marvel
  project to be finished, it will provide real TV-out drivers, I hope.

  My current problem is that BES is working only with CRTC1. So picture
  will always shown up on head routed to CRTC1 (normaly the monitor),
  so i have to swap CRTC's, but this way your console will framebuffer
  (CRTC2 can't do text-mode) and a bit slow (no acceleration). :(


  > anyway i also just get monochrome output on the tv ...
  Maybe you have NTSC TV? Or just didn't run one of TV-* scripts.

  <A NAME=5.1>5.1.  CD-ROM drives

  From Linux documentation:

  Some CDROM drives are capable of changing their head-speed. There are several
  reasons for changing the speed of a CDROM drive. Badly pressed CDROMs may
  benefit from less-than-maximum head rate. Modern CDROM drives can obtain very
  high head rates (up to 24-times is common).  It has been reported that these
  drives can make reading errors at these high speeds, reducing the speed can
  prevent data loss in these circumstances.  Finally, some of these drives can
  make an annoyingly loud noise, which a lower speed may reduce.

  The recommended way to do it is with a program called 'setcd' . It's kinda
  old, but won't be too hard to find on the Net.
  Use it with :


		setcd -x [speed] [cdrom device]


  Also you can try :


		echo current_speed:4 >/proc/ide/[cdrom device]/settings


  but you'll need root privileges. I use following command too :


		echo file_readahead:2000000 >/proc/ide/[cdrom device]/settings


  for 2MB prefetched reading from the file (it's useful for scratched CDROMs).
  It's recommended that you tuneup your CDROM drive also with hdparm :


		hdparm -d1 -a8 -u1 <cdrom device>


  to enable using DMA access, readahead, and IRQ unmasking.
  (if you don't understand these, *read the hdparm manpage*)

  Please refer to "/proc/ide/[cdrom device]/settings" for fine-tuning your
  CDROM.


  <A NAME=5.2>5.2.  DVD drives

  IMPORTANT NOTE: please _DO_NOT_ require further features for DVD playback. This
  is extremly experimental hack. Maybe it won't work for you. If you're
  capable of helping us do it now! First we would like to fix existing problems.
  Then we can start implementing advanced DVD playback functions of course.

  This means current DVD functions are mainly for developers and not for users!

  First, you must compile and install libcss on your system.
  Second, you have to recompile <B>MPlayer</B> with libcss support. There is
  autodetection of libcss, but if it fails, see below :

  Call ./configure script of <B>MPlayer</B> with these options:

  ./configure --enable-css --with-csslibdir=/usr/local/lib --with-cssincdir=/usr/local/include

  (of course you can append your favourite options as well)

  --with-csslibdir=/usr/local/lib
	Directory contains libcss.so shared library. This directory should
	be in your /etc/ld.so.conf as well.
	
  --with-cssincdir=/usr/local/include
	Directory contains header file 'css.h' of libcss.

  mplayer -dvdauth /dev/dvd /mnt/cdrom/video_ts/vts_01_1.vob

  where,

	'-dvdauth /dev/dvd' tells <B>MPlayer</B> the device name of your DVD drive.
	it's used in disc authentication process

	the filename is simply a VOB file path on the disc

  Note that according to my experiences, disc authentication requires root
  privileges so you must run <B>MPlayer</B> as root! (see section 'Problems').

  NOTE about the sound:
	It seems that <B>MPlayer</B> sometimes fails to find the first audio stream.
	You can specify it with the '-aid 128' option, for example.
	Please experience with 128,129 and similar values. See section
	'Problems'.

  On my AMD K6-2 with using hw scaling and colorspace conversion
  capability of my G400 it's possible to watch DVD with about 70%
  CPU usage with '-nosound'. Unfortunately with sound my machine is
  not enough :( Maybe it can be improved somewhat ...
  Guess, it's not so bad ... According to reports from my friends
  xine uses 80-90% CPU to play DVD on much more powerful machines
  like 1GHz Athlon systems (as far as I know, it's said that about
  300MHz celeron is the minimum to watch DVDs ... using windows
  DVD viewers).

  Hint: I commented out downmix functions from libac3 (of course in this way I
  can't get sound) and audio decoding CPU usage became 11% instead of 24 on
  my machine. This clearly indicates that we should optimize downmix functions
  (KNI code is no use for my k6-2).

  HOT NEWZ:
  We have got 3Dnow optimized libac3. Wow ;-)


  Problems (TODO)

  * disc authentication (the FIBMAP ioctl) requires root privilegies.
    this is strange since OMS can do it as user too.
  * sound. I'm using my only DVD disc (The Matrix) to test <B>MPlayer</B>.
    some VOB file have English sound, some have Spanish and some have
    no sound at all.
    IT SEEMS that if I give '-aid 128' everything works with English sound ...
  * strange effects but only with SOME vob files (it looks like some interlacing
    effect, eg: every 2nd line on the screen is from the last frame).


  Feature TODO

  * chapter scanner
  * audio stream scanner and allow to select one on runtime as well
    (in stage#1 it would be enough to select one on the startup, see
    'Problems' above)
  * DVD menu
    I found (at least on disc 'The Matrix') the menu VOB but I don't
    know how can it be used.
    (after some eyeballing on the source of OMS, it seems we would have to
    parse *.ifo files)
  * subtitle support
  * OSD/GUI (?) support for select chapter, subtitle and audio stream
  * getting some documentation on DVD format, eg: which is the 'root' VOB
    file on the disc in video_ts directory, which is the menu and so on.
  * improve performance (see 'Performance' above)


  No sound problem (from Matrix DVD, the menu VOB)

  End of packet while searching for PCM header

  DEMUXER: Too many (2048 in 4131540 bytes) video packets in the buffer!
  (maybe you play a non-interleaved stream/file or video codec failed)
  MPEG: No Audio stream found...  ->nosound

  However this does not occur if you specify '-aid 128'.


  <A NAME=5.3>5.3.  MTRR

  It is VERY recommended to set MTRR registers up properly, because they can
  give a big performance boost. First you have to find the base address.
  You have 3 ways to find it:

  - from X11 startup messages, for example:

  (--) SVGA: PCI: Matrox MGA G400 AGP rev 4, Memory @ 0xd8000000, 0xd4000000
  (--) SVGA: Linear framebuffer at 0xD8000000

  - from /proc/pci (use lspci -v command):

  01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc.: Unknown device 0525
          Memory at d8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
        
  - from mga_vid kernel driver messages (use dmesg):

  mga_mem_base = d8000000

  Then let's find the memory size. This is very easy, just convert video ram
  size to hexadecimal, or use this table:


		1 MB    0x100000
		2 MB    0x200000
		4 MB    0x400000
		8 MB    0x800000
		16 MB   0x1000000
		32 MB   0x2000000


  You know base address and memory size, let's setup mtrr registers!
  For example, for the Matrox card above (base=0xd8000000) with 32MB
  ram (size=0x2000000) just execute:


      echo "base=0xd8000000 size=0x2000000 type=write-combining" >| /proc/mtrr


  Not all CPUs support MTRRs. For example older K6-2's [around 266Mhz,
  stepping 0] doesn't support MTRR, but stepping 12's do ('cat /proc/cpuinfo'
  to check it).


  <A NAME=6>6. FAQ section (TODO)


  <A NAME=6.1>6.1.  Compilation

  <B>Q: What's the problem with gcc 2.96 ?
  </B>A: gcc 2.96 is RedHat's UNOFFICIAL (it can be found only on RedHat sites, or
     RedHat distributions) and BUGGY gcc release. gcc 2.96 is TOTALLY
     unsupported by <B>MPlayer</B>, because it simply SKIPS MMX codes, it just does not
     compile it. Important: this is NOT an <B>MPlayer</B>-specific problem, numerous
     other projects (DRI, avifile, etc..) have problems with this shit too.
     ** DO NOT USE gcc 2.96 !!! **

  <B>Q: SDL output doesn't work or compile. Problem is ....
  </B>A: It is tested with newest SDL (probably runs on 1.1.7+).
     It does NOT work with 1.1.6, 1.1.5 1.1.4 1.1.3 1.0.4 etc, don't ask.

  <B>Q: I am still having trouble compiling with SDL support. gcc says something
     about "undefined reference to `SDL_EnableKeyRepeat'"   What's now?
  </B>A: Where did you install the SDL library? If you installed in /usr/local
     (the default) then edit the top level config.mak and add
     "-L/usr/local/lib " after "X_LIBS=" Now type make. You're done!

  <B>Q: It doesn't compile, and it misses uint64_t inttypes.h and similar things...
  </B>A: copy DOCS/inttypes.h to <B>MPlayer</B> directory (cp DOCS/inttypes.h .)
     try again... if fail, contact us

  <B>Q: I have Pentium III but ./configure doesn't detect SSE
  </B>A: Only kernel versions 2.4.x supports SSE (or try latest 2.2.19 or newer, but
     be prepared for problems)

  <B>Q: I have G200/G400, how to compile/use mga_vid driver?
  </B>A: Read all this documentation.

  <B>Q: Are there rpm/deb/... packages of <B>MPlayer</B>?
  </B>A: You can make a .deb package for yourself, check section <A HREF="#7.1">7.1</A> .
     It's _STRONGLY_ discouraged to use precompiled packages
     of <B>MPlayer</B>, since it (currently) _highly_ depends on compile-time
     options and optimizations!
     Precompiled packages are COMPLETELY unsupported by the <B>MPlayer</B> team!

  <B>Q: During 'make', <B>MPlayer</B> complains about X11 libraries. I don't understand,
     I DO have X installed!?
  </B>A: ...but you don't have the X development package installed. Or not
     correctly. It's called XFree86-devel* under RedHat, and xlib6g-dev* under
     Debian.  Also check if the /usr/X11 symlink exists (this can be a problem on
     Mandrake systems). It can be created with the
	$ ln -sf /usr/X11R6 /usr/X11
     command. Also check the /usr/include/X11 link :
	$ ln -sf /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11
     Your distribution may differ from the Linux Filesystem Standard.

  <B>Q: What about DGA driver? I can't find it!!!
  </B>A: ./configure autodetects your DGA driver. If -vo help doesn't show
     DGA, then there's a problem with your X installation.
     Try ./configure --enable-dga (and read VIDEOCARDS)
     Alternatively, try SDL's DGA driver with '-vo sdl:dga' options.

  <B>Q: I can't compile SVGAlib.. I'm using 2.3/2.4 kernel.
  </B>A: You have to edit SVGAlib's Makefile.cfg and comment "BACKGROUND = y" out.

  <B>Q: I compiled <B>MPlayer</B> with libcss support, but when I try to start
        it, it says :
	  > error while loading shared libraries: libcss.so.0: cannot load
	  > shared object file: No such file or directory
	I checked up on the file and it IS there in /usr/local/lib.
  </B>A: What are you doing on Linux? Can't you install a library? Why do
    we get these questions? It's not <B>MPlayer</B> specific at all! Add
    /usr/local/lib to <B>/etc/ld.so.conf</B> and run <B>ldconfig</B> .

  <A NAME=6.2>6.2.  General questions

  <B>Q: What about DVD playback?
  </B>A: Read files 'DVD' and 'DVD-FAQ'.

  <B>Q: -xy option doesn't work with x11 driver (-vo x11)
  </B>A: x11 driver doesn't support scaling, but XF86VidMode support is now
     used: you must specify the -vm and the -fs switch, and you're done.
     Make sure you have the right Modelines in your XF86Config file, and
     try if the DGA driver (and SDL's DGA driver, see VIDEOCARDS) works for you.
     It's much faster. If SDL's DGA works too, use that, it'll be EVEN
     faster!

  <B>Q: what is the meaning of numbers in the status line?
  </B>A: see:
         </B>A:   2.1  V:   2.2  A-V: -0.167  ct:  0.042   57  41%   0%  2.6% 0
     -   </B>A: audio position in seconds
     - V: video position in seconds
     - A-V: audio-video difference in seconds (delay)
     - ct: total A-V sync correction done
     - frames played (counting from last seek)
     - video codec cpu usage in percent (for mpeg it includes video_out too!)
     - video_out cpu usage for avi, 0 for mpg (see above)
     - audio codec cpu usage in percent
     - frames needed to drop to maintain A-V sync
     Most of them are for debug purposes, and will be removed soon.

  <B>Q: Why is video_out cpu usage zero (0%) for mpeg files?
  </B>A: It's not zero, but it's built in into codec, so can't be measured separated.
     You should try to play the file using -vo null and then -vo ... and check
     the difference to see video_out speed...

  <B>Q: What's XMMP? (is it XMMS or XMPS but mispelled?)
  </B>A: It's a new project, see http://frozenproductions.com for details

  <B>Q: There are error messages about file not found /usr/lib/win32/....
  </B>A: Download & install w32codec.zip from *our* FTP
     (avifile's codec package has different DLL set)

  <B>Q: Are there any mailing lists on <B>MPlayer</B>?
  </B>A: Yes! See README on how to subscribe them!

  <B>Q: I've found a nasty bug when I tried to play my favourite video!!
     Who should I inform?
  </B>A: See Appendix <A HREF="#C">C</A> .

 <B>Q: I have problems playing files with ... codec. Can I use'em?
  </B>A: Check http://mplayer.sourceforge.net/DOCS/codecs.html,
     if it doesn't contain your codec, read
     http://mplayer.sourceforge.net/DOCS/CODECS, and contact us.

  <B>Q: Umm, what is "IdegCounter" ?
  </B>A: A mixture of a hungarian and an english word. In english, "Ideg" means
     "nerve", and is pronounced as something like "ydaegh" . It was first used
     to measure the nervousness of A'rpi, after some (umm) "mystic" disappearance
     of CVS code ;)

  <B>Q: LIRC doesn't work, because ...
  </B>A: Are you sure you use "mplayer_lirc" instead of "mplayer" ?

  <B>Q: Subtitles are very nice, the most beautiful I've ever seen, but they slow
     down the playing! I know it's unlikely...
  </B>A: After running ./configure , edit config.h and replace #undef FAST_OSD with
     #define FAST_OSD . Then recompile.

  <B>Q: The OSD is flickering!
  </B>A: You use a vo driver with single buffering (x11,xv). With xv you can change
     the number of buffers in libvo/vo_xv.c :
     Increase #define NUM_BUFFERS 1

  <B>Q: What exactly is this libavcodec?
  </B>A: It's from Gerard Lantau's ffmpeg package (http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net).
     It has Clanguage DivX ;-) and OpenDivX codec.  Some benchmarks
     showed that its DivX seems to be even faster than DirectShow codec without
     preprocessing, and only a few percent slower than ProjectMayo's OpenDivX
     decoder.  It uses YV12 pixel format, so old Voodoo users can use it for YUV.
     Also, open the possibility to play DivX on virtually every computer that
     has a C compiler. Kinda great stuff, isn't it?


  <A NAME=6.3>6.3.  File playing problems

  <B>Q: ...... works with avifile/aviplay while doesn't with <B>MPlayer</B>
  </B>A: <B>MPlayer</B> != avifile
     The only common thing between these players is the Win32 DLL loader.
     The codecs (dll) sets, syncronization, demultiplexing etc is totaly
     different and shouldn't be compared.
     If something works with aviplay it doesn't mean that <B>MPlayer</B> should do
     it and vice versa.

  <B>Q: audio goes out of sync playing .avi file
  </B>A: try with -bps or -nobps option
     if still bad, send me (upload to ftp) that file, I'll check.

  <B>Q: Indeo 3.x/4.x movies are viewed upside-down!!!?
  </B>A: It's a known bug (really it's a bug/limitation of the DLL codec)
     Try if your vo driver supports the -flip switch.

  <B>Q: Indeo 3.x,4.x video doesn't work at 32bpp resolutions (16,24 bpp are ok)
  </B>A: It's a known bug (really it's a bug/limitation of the DLL codec)

  <B>Q: I've got '<B>MPlayer</B> interrupted by signal 11' in module audio_setup or
     decode_audio.
  </B>A: This is highly unlikely, since the mp3lib rewrite. Contact us, it may be
     a bug. Possibly it's a damaged file, try with -afm 4 .

  <B>Q: <B>MPlayer</B> exits with something error when using l3codeca.acm
  </B>A: Check 'ldd /usr/local/bin/mplayer' output. If it contains
          libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4???????)
     where "?" is any number then it's ok, the error is not here. If it is:
	libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00??????)
     then there is problem with your kernel/libc. Maybe you are using some
     security patches (for example Solar Designer's OpenWall patch) which
     forces loading libraries to very low addresses.
     Because l3codeca.acm is a non-relocatable DLL, it must be loaded to
     0x00400000, we can't change this. You should use non-patched kernel,
     or use <B>MPlayer</B>'s -afm 1 option to disable using l3codeca.acm.

  <B>Q: My computer plays M$ DivX AVIs with resolutions ~ 640x300 and stereo mp3
     sound too slow. When I use -nosound switch, everything is ok (but quiet).
  </B>A: Those files probably have 48Khz audio, and your soundcard/driver can't play
     it correctly. Audio downsampling isn't implemented in <B>MPlayer</B> (yet).
 
  <B>Q: <B>MPlayer</B> dies with "<B>MPlayer</B> interrupted by signal 4 in module: decode_video".
  </B>A: Try running <B>MPlayer</B> on the machine you compiled on. Or recompile. Don't
     use <B>MPlayer</B> on different CPU than it was compiled on.

  <B>Q: I have problems with [your window manager] and fullscreen xv/xmga/sdl/x11
     modes..
  </B>A1: Use the -fsmode switch. See example.conf or manpage.

  <B>Q: But it works with avifile !
  </B>A: So what?

  <B>Q: Then avifile is better !
  </B>A: Then use avifile, it has nice GUI and nice C++ code :)

  <B>Q: I got this playing mpeg files: Can't find codec for video format 0x10000001 !
  </B>A: You have old version of codecs.conf at ~/.mplayer/. Upgrade it from DOCS/

  <B>Q: After starting mplayer under KDE(1/2) I just get a black screen and nothing 
     happens, after about one minute the video starts playing.
  </B>A: The KDE arts sound daemon is blocking the sound device, either wait the time
     until video starts or you disable the arts-daemon in kontrollcenter.


  <A NAME=6.4>6.4.  Video/audio driver problems (vo/ao)

  <B>Q: Ok, -vo help shows DGA driver, but it is babbling about permissions!
     Help me!
  </B>A: It works only if running as root! It's a DGA limitation.
     You should become to root (su -), and try again.

   Another solution is making mplayer SUID root, but its NOT RECOMMENDED!

	chown root /usr/local/bin/mplayer
	chmod 750 /usr/local/bin/mplayer
	chmod +s /usr/local/bin/mplayer

                           !!!! BUT STAY TUNED !!!!
    This is a *BIG* security risk! *NEVER* do this on a server or on a computer
    can be accessed by more people than only you because they can gain root
    privilegies through suid root mplayer!!!
                       !!!! SO YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ... !!!!

  <B>Q: When using Xvideo, my Voodoo 3/Banshee says:
     X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource
     denied)
      Major opcode of failed request:  147 (MIT-SHM)
      Minor opcode of failed request:  1 (X_ShmAttach)
      Serial number of failed request:  26
      Current serial number in output stream:27 
  </B>A: Your driver is old, update it. Either download (at least) DRI version 0.6
     from http://dri.sourceforge.net , or use the DRI cvs.

  <B>Q: When using Xvideo, I can't play DivX avis with my Voodoo 3/Banshee !
     It says:
      ...
      Xvideo image format: 0x32315659 (YV12) planar
      Xvideo image format: 0x30323449 (I420) planar
      ...
  </B>A1: See the previous answer.
  A2: Since 0.18pre4 we include libavcodec from the ffmpeg package. It contains
      a C language DivX and OpenDivX decoder. The DivX decoder uses YV12 format
      for output, thus it should work for you. Compile in libavcodec support.

  <B>Q: OpenGL (-vo gl) output doesn't work (hangup/black window/X11 errors/...)
  </B>A: your opengl driver doesn't support dynamic texture changes (glTexSubImage)
     it's known not to work with nVidia's binary shit.
     it's known to work with Utah-GLX/DRI and Matrox G400 card. Also with
     DRI and Radeon card. It won't work with DRI others than these.
     it will not work with 3DFX cards because the 256x256 texture size limit.

  <B>Q: I have an nVidia TNT/TNT2 card, and I have a band with strange colours,
     right under the movie! Whose fault is this?
  </B>A: It's the nVidia X driver's. These bugs are ONLY with the TNT/TNT2 cards,
     and we can't do anything about it, it's not our bug.


  <A NAME=6.5>6.5.  Feature requests

  <B>Q: Is there a hint on how to watch QuickTime and RealMedia movies in MPlayer?
  </B>A: There's no way to do it. Therefore these formats deserve to die in flames.
     Theoretically you can reverse engineer Real codecs built for Linux (they
     are available as .so files), but in practice that's really difficult, even
     if you know how the compiler used by Real is making assembler code.
     As for QuickTime, it's possible to play some old movies and this
     capability will be added to mplayer soon, but newer clips are all Sorenson
     encoded, and that codec is built-in deep in the QT executable, there's
     no way to use it.


  <A NAME=6.6>6.6.  DVD FAQ

  <B>Q: I have some problem not mentioned here ...
  </B>A: Read file 'DVD' as well.

  <B>Q: How can I actually watch DVD with MPlayer?
  </B>A: Ehh. Go on reading this file as well as 'DVD' (hint: you must have libcss)

  <B>Q: So MPlayer can play DVDs? Then it must use DeCSS! You are under arrest
     under the XYZ#$ paragraph of the--
  </B>A: Get back asshole, there is no DeCSS code in MPlayer. It links to libcss.

  <B>Q: Seems to work but no sound.
  </B>A: Use '-aid 128' (or try: 128,129,...) command line switch

  <B>Q: I have got Spanish audio instead of English (or similar problems)
  </B>A: See the last question/answer.

  <B>Q: MPlayer complains about FIBMAP or something.
  </B>A: Try to run MPlayer as root.

  <B>Q: some strange effect (interlace like thing) especially when fast moving
     objects are shown in the movie
  </B>A: known problem, we try to fix it later

  <B>Q: DVD support in MPlayer is a piece of shit!
  </B>A: You're probably right :) However please contact us if you can improve it!

  <B>Q: Where can I get libcss package from?
  </B>A: Maybe from the source of OMS (www.linuxvideo.org).

  <B>Q: How can I ... (insert some expectable DVD player feature here)
  </B>A: The current implementation is only for viewing VOB files from DVD.
     Nothing more, like subtitles, menus and so on.

  <B>Q: How can I set the region code of my DVD-Drive ? I don't have windows!
  </B>A: Use the 'regionset' tool :
     http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvd/dvd_disc_20000215.tar.gz

  <B>Q: MPlayer complains about some renamed option?
  </B>A: For future development, old '-dvd' option was replaced by '-dvdauth'.
     Option '-dvd' *WILL* do the 'full disk movie' mplaying mode.
     But until that, '-dvd' does nothing only prints error message.


  <A NAME=7>7. Misc OS'es


  <A NAME=7.1>7.1.  Debian packaging

  To build the package, get the cvs version, or .tgz and uncompress it,
  and cd into programs directory:


		cd main

  (... mplayer detects hardware/software, builds itself and.. )
  dpkg-deb: building package `mplayer' in `../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb'.

  And now just become root, and :


		dpkg -i ../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb as root.


  Here's how it looks like:

	eyck@incubus:/src/main$ sudo dpkg -i ../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb 
	Password:
	(Reading database ... 26946 files and directories currently installed.)

  <A NAME=7.2>7.2.  FreeBSD

  To build the package you will need GNU make (gmake, /usr/ports/devel/gmake), 
  native BSD make will not work.

  To run <B>MPlayer</B> you will need to re-compile the kernel with 
  "options USER_LDT" (unless you are running -CURRENT, where this is default).

  If <B>MPlayer</B> complains about "CD-ROM Device '/dev/cdrom' not found!" make a 
  symbolic link : ln -s /dev/<your_cdrom_device> /dev/cdrom 

  There's no DVD support for FreeBSD yet. 
  Feel free to add it :-)


  <A NAME=7.3>7.3.  Solaris 8

  AVI file playback works best on Solaris x86, because you have the
  option to use the win32 codecs on the x86 platform.  On Solaris SPARC,
  you'll find quite a few AVI files with non working video and/or
  audio playback, because the video/audio codecs using the win32 DLLs
  are not available. However, <B>DivX/OpenDivX</B> movies should work,
  when using libavcodec.

  To build the package you will need GNU make (gmake, /opt/sfw/gmake), native
  Solaris make will not work. Typical error you get when building with solaris'
  make instead of GNU make:


   % /usr/ccs/bin/make
   make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 25: Unexpected end of line seen


  On Solaris SPARC, you need the GNU C/C++ Compiler; it does not matter
  if GNU C/C++ compiler is configured with or without the GNU assembler.

  On Solaris x86, you need the GNU assembler and the GNU C/C++
  compiler, configured to use the GNU assembler!  The mplayer code on
  the x86 platform makes heavy use of MMX, SSE and 3DNOW!
  instructions that cannot be compiled using Sun's assembler
  /usr/ccs/bin/as.

  The configure script tries to find out, which assembler program is
  used by your "gcc" command (in case the autodetection fails, use
  the "--as=/whereever/you/have/installed/gnu-as" option to tell the
  configure script where it can find GNU "as" on your system).

  Error message from configure on a Solaris x86 system using GCC
  without GNU assembler:

   % configure
   ...
   Checking assembler (/usr/ccs/bin/as) ... , failed
   Please upgrade(downgrade) binutils to 2.10.1...

  (Solution: Install and use a gcc configured with "--with-as=gas")

  Typical error you get when building with a GNU C compiler that does
  not use GNU as:

   % gmake
   ...
   gcc -c -Iloader -Ilibvo -O4 -march=i686 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -ffast-math 
	-fomit-frame-pointer  -I/usr/local/include   -o mplayer.o mplayer.c
   Assembler: mplayer.c
   "<stdin>", line 3567 : Illegal mnemonic
   "<stdin>", line 3567 : Syntax error
   ... more "Illegal mnemonic" and "Syntax error" errors ...


  For DVD support you must have the patched libcss installed. Patch:
  http://www.tools.de/solaris/mplayer/


  Due to two bugs in solaris 8 x86,  you cannot reliably play DVDs using a
  capacity >4GB: 

   - The sd(7D) driver on solaris 8 x86 driver has bug when accessing a
     disk block >4GB on a device using a logical blocksize != DEV_BSIZE
     (i.e. CDROM and DVD media).  Due to a 32bit int overflow, a disk
     address modulo 4GB is accessed.
     (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisonintel/message/22516)

   - The similar bug is present in the hsfs(7FS) filesystem code (aka
     ISO9660), hsfs currently does not support partitions/disks >4GB,
     all data is accessed modulo 4GB
     (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisonintel/message/22592)


  <A NAME=7.4>7.4.  StrongARM

  MPlayer is reported to compile on StrongARM. Use the following command line:


  ./configure --target=arm-linux --disable-css --with-x11libdir=/usr/arm/lib
	      --with-x11incdir=/usr/arm/lib --disable-gcc-checking

  <A NAME=C>Appendix C - How to report bugs

How to report bugs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First read DOCS/BUGS, and other docs. If your problem isn't
known or isn't solved by our instructions, then report the bug:

Where?
======
Subscribe to the mplayer-users mailing list:
   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mplayer-users
and send your bugreport to:
   mplayer-users@lists.sourceforge.net
We won't CC: so please subscribe!!!

Don't send bugreports private, directly to author's address!!!
We are working together on code, so everyone is interested in it.
BTW many times other users know the solution (system config probs,
bad drivers etc), even when we think it's a bug in our code.
The language of this list is ENGLISH !

Please describe your problem in details, examples etc, and don't
forget to include these:

What?
=====

1. The system info what we always want:
- linux distribution
  examples: 
    RedHat 7.1
    Slackware 7.0 + devel packs from 7.1 ...
- kernel version:
  uname -a
- libc version:
  ls -l /lib/libc[.-]*
- X version:
  X -version
- gcc and ld version:
  gcc -v
  ld -v
- binutils version:
  as --version

2. Hardware & drivers:
- CPU info:
  cat /proc/cpuinfo
- video card manufacturer and model
  examples:
    ASUS V3800U chip: nVidia TNT2 Ultra pro 32MB SDRAM
    Matrox G400 DH 32MB SGRAM
- video driver type&version
  examples:
    X built-in driver
    nvidia 0.9.623
    Utah-GLX CVS 2001-02-17
    DRI from X 4.0.3
- sound card type & driver
  examples:
    Creative SBLive! Gold with OSS driver from oss.creative.com
    Creative SB16 with OSS drivers of kernel
    GUS PnP with ALSA OSS emulation
- if you are unsure, attach output of lspci -v

For compiling problems/errors:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. output of configure/make:
     make distclean
     ./configure &>config.log
     ./make &>make.log
4. these files:
     config.h
     config.mak
     libvo/config.mak

For playback problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. Output of mplayer at verbose level 1 (-v)
  mplayer -v [options] filename &> mplayer.log
  
4. If the problem is specific to one or a few files,
  then please upload that file to:
    ftp://mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/
  Usually first 1-5 MB of the file is enough to reproduce
  the problem, but first you should try it:
    dd if=yourfile of=smallfile bs=1k count=1024
  (it will cut first 1MB of 'yourfile' and save to 'smallfile')
  Then try again on this small file, and if bug still exists
  then it's enough to upload this small file.
  NEVER send such files via mail! Upload it, and send only
  the path/filename of the file on the FTP.
  If the file is accessible on the net, then sending the
  _exact_ URL is enough!

5. For crashes (segfault, SIGILL, signal 4 etc):

If you have coredump of the crash, see 5.a, else see 5.b:

5.a: Please print us coredump (if it was created).
Howto:
please create following command file:

disass $eip-32 $eip+32
printf "eax=%08lX\n",$eax
printf "ebx=%08lX\n",$ebx
printf "ecx=%08lX\n",$ecx
printf "edx=%08lX\n",$edx
printf "esp=%08lX\n",$esp
printf "ebp=%08lX\n",$ebp
printf "edi=%08lX\n",$edi
printf "esi=%08lX\n",$esi

Then simply execute following command line:
gdb mplayer --core=core -batch --command=command_file >mplayer.bug

5.b.: run <B>MPlayer</B> in gdb:
[at root/user shell prompt:]
  # gdb mplayer
[at gdb prompt:]
  > run -v [options-to-mplayer] filename
  ... (wait until it will crash)
  > bt
  > disass $eip-32 $eip+32
Send us the full output of the above things!

In general:
~~~~~~~~~~~
  If something is big (logs etc) then it's better to upload to the ftp
  (gzipped), and include only path/filename in the bugreport!
