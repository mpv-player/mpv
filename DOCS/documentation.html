  <A NAME=1>1.  Introduction


  <A NAME=1.1>1.1.  Overview

  <B>MPlayer</B> is a movie player for LINUX. It plays most MPEG, AVI and ASF files,
  supported by many native and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and
  even DivX movies too. The another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of
  supported output drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,
  AAlib, but you can use SDL (and this way all drivers of SDL) and some
  lowlevel card-specific drivers (for Matrox) too! Most of them supports
  software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen. And what
  about the nice big antialiased shaded subtitles (7 supported types!!!) with
  hungarian, english, cyrillic, czech, korean fonts, and OSD?

  I didn't write any codecs, just some players. I spent
  a lot of time finding the best way to parse bad damaged input files
  (both MPEG and AVI) and to do perfect A-V sync with seeking ability.
  My player is rock solid playing damaged MPEG files (useful for some VCDs),
  and it plays bad AVI files which are unplayable with the famous
  windows media player. Even AVI files without index chunk are playable, and
  you can rebuild their indexes with the -idx option, thus enabling seeking!
  As you see, stability and quality are the most important things for me,
  but the speed is also amazing.


  <A NAME=1.2>1.2.  History

  This began a year ago...
  I've tried lots of players under linux (mtv,xmps,dvdview,livid/oms,VideoLAN,
  xine,xanim,avifile,xmmp) but they all have some problem. Mostly with special
  files or with audio/video sync. Most of them is unable to play both MPEG1,
  MPEG2 and AVI (DivX) files. Many players have image quality or speed problems
  too. So I've decided to write/modify one...

  - mpg12play v0.1-v0.3:
    The first try, hacked together in a half hour!
    I've used libmpeg3 from www.heroinewarrior.com up to the version 0.3,
    but there were image quality and speed problems with it.
  - mpg12play v0.5-v0.87:
    Mpeg codec replaced with DVDview by Dirk Farin, it was a great stuff,
    but it was slow and was written in C++ (I hate C++!!!)
  - mpg12play v0.9-v0.95pre5:
    Mpeg codec was libmpeg2 (mpeg2dec) by Aaron Holtzman & Michel Lespinasse.
    It's great, optimized very fast C code with perfect image quality and
    100% MPEG standard conformance.
  - <B>MPlayer</B> v0.3-v0.9:
    It was a pack of two programs: mpg12playv0.95pre6 and my new simple AVI
    player 'avip' based on avifile's Win32 DLL loader.
  - <B>MPlayer</B> v0.10:
    The MPEG and AVI player in a single binary!
  - <B>MPlayer</B> v0.11:
    Some new developers joined and from 0.11 the mplayer project is a team-work!
    Added .ASF file support, and OpenDivX (see www.projectmayo.com) en/decoding.
  - <B>MPlayer</B> v0.17 "The IdegCounter"
    The release version of the 0.11pre after 4 months of heavy development!
    Try it, and be amazed! Thousands of new features added... and of course
    old code was improved too, bugs removed etc.
  - <B>MPlayer</B> 0.18 "The BugCounter"
    2 months since 0.17 and here's a new release.. Completed ASF support,
    more subtitle formats, introduced libao (similar to libvo but to audio),
    even more stable than ever, and so on. It's a MUST !  


  <A NAME=1.3>1.3.  Installation

  If you plan to use <B>MPlayer</B> on x86 architecture, you possibly want to use
  Win32 codecs. Download and unzip w32codecs.zip to /usr/lib/win32 .
  Note: the avifile project has similar codecs package, but it differs
  from our, so if you want to use all supported codecs, then use
  our package! However, you can use our codecs package with avifile.

  If you own a Matrox G200/G400/G450 card, then please see the <A HREF="video.html#2.2.1.7">2.2.1.7</A>
  section in order to gain big speedup. It is important to do these steps
  _before_ compiling <B>MPlayer</B>, otherwise no Matrox-specific support will be
  built.

  If you plan to use the ProjectMayo's <B>OpenDivX</B> codec, check the
  <A HREF="codecs.html#2.1.2.1">2.1.2.1</A> section before compiling.

  Then build <B>MPlayer</B>:


	./configure
	make
	make install


  It is recommended to browse the output of ./configure , it contains info
  about what will be built, and what won't. You may also want to view
  config.h and config.mak files.

  Though not mandatory, the fonts should be installed in order to gain
  OSD, and subtitle functionality. Download mp_font3.zip (and optional
  language updates) and optional (if exists) language updates.


	mkdir ~/.mplayer/font
	cd ~/.mplayer/font
	unzip mp_font3.zip
	unzip mp_font3_hu.zip


  <A NAME=1.4>1.4.  What about the GUI ?

  I'm not a GUI programmer. I hate GUIs, I like the pure black 80x25 console.
  So the player has only keyboard control from the controlling console/xterm now.
  There is a GUI development for the player, coordinated by Pontscho/Fresh!
  It's still under development, but it will be merged and released real soon.
  BTW he needs some nice skins, if you are a good graphician, contact him!!!

    l/r arrows		seek backward/forward 10 seconds
    up or down		seek backward/forward 1 minute  
    p or SPACE		pause movie (press any key to continue)
    q  or  ^C		stop playing and quit program
    o			toggle OSD : none / seek / seek+timer
    /  and *		decrease/increase volume
    m			toggle using master/pcm channel for volume setting
    f			toggle fullscreen (only with -vo sdl)


  <A NAME=3.2>3.2.  Control from LIRC

  Linux Infrared Remote Control - use an easy to build home-brewn IR-receiver, 
  an (almost) arbitrary remote control and control your linux box with it!
  More about it at www.lirc.org.

  If you have installed the lirc-package, you can compile <B>MPlayer</B> with LIRC
  support using  ./configure --enable-lirc

  If everything went fine, <B>MPlayer</B> will print a message like 
    LIRC init was successful.
  on startup. If an error occurs it will tell you. If it doens't tell you 
  anything about LIRC there's no support compiled in. That's it :-)

  The application name for <B>MPlayer</B> is - oh wonder - mplayer_lirc.
  It understands the following commands:

  PAUSE  - pause playing. Any other keystroke will continue replay.
  QUIT   - exit mplayer
  RWND   - 10 secs back
  FRWND  - 60 secs back
  FWD    - skip 10 secs
  FFWD   - skip 60 secs
  INCVOL - increase volume one percent
  DECVOL - decrease volmue one percent
  MASTER - use master mixer channel
  PCM    - use pcm mixer channel

  Don't forget to enable the repeat flag for RWND/FWD in .lircrc. Here's an
  excerpt from my .lircrc:

  begin
   remote = CU-SX070
   prog = mplayer_lirc
   button = Tape_Play
   repeat = 1
   config = FFWD
  end

  begin
   remote = CU-SX070
   prog = mplayer_lirc
   button = Tape_Stop
   config = QUIT
  end

  If you don't like the standard location for the lirc-config file (~/.lircrc) 
  use the -lircconf [filename] switch to specify another file.


  <A NAME=3.3>3.3.  Streaming from network or pipes

  <B>MPlayer</B> can play media from network, by using the HTTP protocol, and even
  beta ASF streaming (FROM network) is available.
  Configuring it is simple, just recompile <B>MPlayer</B> with


	./configure --enable-streaming


  <B>MPlayer</B> can read from stdin (NOT named pipes). This can be for example
  used to play from FTP :


        wget ftp://micorsops.com/something.avi -O - | mplayer -


  <A NAME=4>4.  <A HREF="faq.html">FAQ section</A>


  <A NAME=5>5.  <A HREF="dvd.html">CD/DVD section</A>


  <A NAME=6>6. Misc OS'es


  <A NAME=6.1>6.1.  Debian packaging

  To build the package, get the cvs version, or .tgz and uncompress it,
  and cd into programs directory:


		cd main
		fakeroot debian/rules binary


  (... mplayer detects hardware/software, builds itself and.. )
  dpkg-deb: building package `mplayer' in `../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb'.

  And now just become root, and :


		dpkg -i ../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb as root.


  Here's how it looks like:

	eyck@incubus:/src/main$ sudo dpkg -i ../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb 
	Password:
	(Reading database ... 26946 files and directories currently installed.)
	Preparing to replace mplayer 0.17a-1 (using ../mplayer_0.18-1_i386.deb)
	Unpacking replacement mplayer ...
	Setting up mplayer (0.18-1) ...


  <A NAME=6.2>6.2.  FreeBSD

  To build the package you will need GNU make (gmake, /usr/ports/devel/gmake), 
  native BSD make will not work.

  To run <B>MPlayer</B> you will need to re-compile the kernel with 
  "options USER_LDT" (unless you are running -CURRENT, where this is default).
  If you have a CPU with SSE also use "options CPU_ENABLE_SSE" to use it
  (FreeBSD-STABLE required, or use kernel patches).

  If <B>MPlayer</B> complains about "CD-ROM Device '/dev/cdrom' not found!" make a 
  symbolic link : ln -s /dev/(your_cdrom_device) /dev/cdrom 

  There's no DVD support for FreeBSD yet. 
  Feel free to add it :-)


  <A NAME=6.3>6.3.  Solaris 8

  AVI file playback works best on Solaris x86, because you have the
  option to use the win32 codecs on the x86 platform.  On Solaris SPARC,
  you'll find quite a few AVI files with non working video and/or
  audio playback, because the video/audio codecs using the win32 DLLs
  are not available. However, <B>DivX/OpenDivX</B> movies should work,
  when using libavcodec.

  To build the package you will need GNU make (gmake, /opt/sfw/gmake), native
  Solaris make will not work. Typical error you get when building with solaris'
  make instead of GNU make:


   % /usr/ccs/bin/make
   make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 25: Unexpected end of line seen


  On Solaris SPARC, you need the GNU C/C++ Compiler; it does not matter
  if GNU C/C++ compiler is configured with or without the GNU assembler.

  On Solaris x86, you need the GNU assembler and the GNU C/C++
  compiler, configured to use the GNU assembler!  The mplayer code on
  the x86 platform makes heavy use of MMX, SSE and 3DNOW!
  instructions that cannot be compiled using Sun's assembler
  /usr/ccs/bin/as.

  The configure script tries to find out, which assembler program is
  used by your "gcc" command (in case the autodetection fails, use
  the "--as=/whereever/you/have/installed/gnu-as" option to tell the
  configure script where it can find GNU "as" on your system).

  Error message from configure on a Solaris x86 system using GCC
  without GNU assembler:

   % configure
   ...
   Checking assembler (/usr/ccs/bin/as) ... , failed
   Please upgrade(downgrade) binutils to 2.10.1...

  (Solution: Install and use a gcc configured with "--with-as=gas")

  Typical error you get when building with a GNU C compiler that does
  not use GNU as:

   % gmake
   ...
   gcc -c -Iloader -Ilibvo -O4 -march=i686 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -ffast-math 
	-fomit-frame-pointer  -I/usr/local/include   -o mplayer.o mplayer.c
   Assembler: mplayer.c
   "(stdin)", line 3567 : Illegal mnemonic
   "(stdin)", line 3567 : Syntax error
   ... more "Illegal mnemonic" and "Syntax error" errors ...


  For DVD support you must have the patched libcss installed. Patch:
  http://www.tools.de/solaris/mplayer/


  Due to two bugs in solaris 8 x86,  you cannot reliably play DVDs using a
  capacity >4GB: 

   - The sd(7D) driver on solaris 8 x86 driver has bug when accessing a
     disk block >4GB on a device using a logical blocksize != DEV_BSIZE
     (i.e. CDROM and DVD media).  Due to a 32bit int overflow, a disk
     address modulo 4GB is accessed.
     (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisonintel/message/22516)

   - The similar bug is present in the hsfs(7FS) filesystem code (aka
     ISO9660), hsfs currently does not support partitions/disks >4GB,
     all data is accessed modulo 4GB
     (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisonintel/message/22592)


  <A NAME=6.4>6.4.  StrongARM

  MPlayer is reported to compile on StrongARM. Use the following command line:


  ./configure --target=arm-linux --disable-css --with-x11libdir=/usr/arm/lib
	      --with-x11incdir=/usr/arm/lib --disable-gcc-checking
