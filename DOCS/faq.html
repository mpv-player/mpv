What's the problem with gcc 2.96 ?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
gcc 2.96 is RedHat's UNOFFICIAL (it can be found only on RedHat sites, or
RedHat distributions) and BUGGY gcc release. gcc 2.96 is TOTALLY
unsupported by <B>MPlayer</B>, because it simply SKIPS MMX codes, it just does
not compile it. Important: this is NOT an <B>MPlayer</B>-specific problem,
numerous other projects (DRI, avifile, etc..) have problems with this shit
too.<BR>** DO NOT USE gcc 2.96 !!! **

Are there rpm/deb/... packages of <B>MPlayer</B>?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
You can make a .deb package for yourself, check section <A HREF="documentation.html#6.1">6.1</A>.
It's _STRONGLY_ discouraged to use precompiled packages
of <B>MPlayer</B>, since it (currently) _highly_ depends on compile-time
options and optimizations!

During 'make', MPlayer complains about X11 libraries. I don't understand,
I DO have X installed!?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
...but you don't have the X development package installed. Or not
correctly. It's called XFree86-devel* under RedHat, and xlib6g-dev* under
Debian.  Also check if the /usr/X11 symlink exists (this can be a problem on
Mandrake systems). It can be created with the<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>$ ln -sf /usr/X11R6 /usr/X11</CODE><BR>
 command. Also check the /usr/include/X11 link :<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>$ ln -sf /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11</CODE><BR>

./configure autodetects your DGA driver. If -vo help doesn't show

What are you doing on Linux? Can't you install a library? Why do

Or install it to /usr/lib , because if you can't solve the /usr/local

-xy option doesn't work with x11 driver (-vo x11)
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
x11 driver doesn't support scaling, but XF86VidMode support is now
used: you must specify the -vm and the -fs switch, and you're done.
Make sure you have the right Modelines in your XF86Config file, and
try if the DGA driver (and SDL's DGA driver, see RTFM) works for you.
It's much faster. If SDL's DGA works too, use that, it'll be EVEN faster!

What exactly is this libavcodec?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
It's from Gerard Lantau's ffmpeg package (http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net).
It has C language DivX ;-) and OpenDivX alpha 47 codec.  Some benchmarks
showed that its DivX seems to be even faster than DirectShow codec without
preprocessing, and only a few percent slower than ProjectMayo's DivX4
decoder. It uses YV12 pixel format, so old Voodoo users can use it for YUV.
Also, open the possibility to play DivX on virtually every computer that
has a C compiler. Kinda great stuff, isn't it?

then there is problem with your kernel/libc. Maybe you are using some
security patches (for example Solar Designer's OpenWall patch) which
forces loading libraries to very low addresses.
Because l3codeca.acm is a non-relocatable DLL, it must be loaded to

The KDE arts sound daemon is blocking the sound device, either wait the time

If you want to use arts sound, specify audio output via SDL (ao=sdl), and

Since 0.18pre4 we support libavcodec from the ffmpeg package. It contains
a C language DivX and OpenDivX decoder. The DivX decoder uses YV12 format
for output, thus it should work for you. Compile in libavcodec support.

Is there a hint on how to watch QuickTime and RealMedia movies in MPlayer?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
There's no way to do it. Therefore these formats deserve to die in flames.
Theoretically you can reverse engineer Real codecs built for Linux (they
are available as .so files), but in practice that's really difficult, even
if you know how the compiler used by Real is making assembler code.
As for QuickTime, it's possible to play some old movies and this
capability will be added to mplayer soon, but newer clips are all Sorenson
encoded, and that codec is built-in deep in the QT executable, there's
no way to use it.
