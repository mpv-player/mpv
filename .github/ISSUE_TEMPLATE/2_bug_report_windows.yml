      description: >
          Try to reproduce your issue with `--no-config` first. If it isn't reproducible
          with `--no-config` try to find out which option or script causes your issue.


          If the issue is render performance-related, try to reproduce it with `--no-config
          --profile=fast`, which is designed to work on lower-end mobile devices.


          For decoding performance-related issues, additionally try to enable hardware
          decoding with `--hwdec=yes` or the `Ctrl+h` shortcut.


          Describe the reproduction steps as precise as possible. It's very likely that
          the bug you experience wasn't reproduced by the developer because the workflow
          differs from your own.

          Make a log file with `--gpu-debug --log-file=output.txt`, which is our preferred way, and
          attach it to the issue.


          If you have trouble producing a log file, you can alternatively use `--gpu-debug -v -v`,
          save the terminal output to a file, and attach it to the issue.


          In the case of a crash, please provide a backtrace, attach the approriate `.dmp` file
          from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps`.


          Without the log file, this issue will be closed for ignoring the issue template.

          Please provide sample files for a minimal reproduction case, if the issue can't be
          reproduced without it or it is helpful to demonstrate the issue.


          Preferably files should be attached directly within the text field below. Due to GitHub's
          upload restriction, you may need to archive the sample file first and upload it as `.zip`
          file. If the sample file is too big to attach directly, use a solution that is easy to
          access with possible long-term retention. Possible services include, but are not limited
          to, the following:

          - [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) (no long-term retention)
