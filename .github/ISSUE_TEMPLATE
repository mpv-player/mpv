### Expected behavior

### Actual behavior

### Log file

Make a log file made with -v -v or --log-file=output.txt, paste it to
https://0x0.st/ or attach it the github issue, and replace this text with a
link to it.

If this is a normal runtime bug, and no log is provided, the issue will be
closed for ignoring the issue template. This is because analyzing a bug without
a log file is harder than necessary. Low quality bug reports are noise.

### Sample files

Sample files needed to reproduce this issue can be uploaded to https://0x0.st/
or similar sites. (Only needed if the issue cannot be reproduced without it.)
Do not use garbage like "cloud storage", especially not Google Drive.
