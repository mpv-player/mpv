Template: mplayer/cfgnote
Type: note
Description: Create your ~/.mplayer/conf file.
 Remember to read documentation and edit your ~/.mplayer/conf
 (or /etc/mplayer.conf) file. This binary depends heavily on
 your hardware - which means that it needs tweaking for every single
 machine it's installed to. And it also it means that it will use
 your setup very effectively. Look at /usr/share/doc/mplayer
