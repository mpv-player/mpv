libdha - Library of Direct Hardware Access.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This library was designed for direct hardware access under different
OS and architectures. It's not linux specific only (like harddrake
and other).

This library is based on gfxdump utility from GATOS project.
Full list of supported OS'es see in libdha.h

Note: This library requires ROOT privileges or SUID'ed executable
file (same as XServer).
(Or use newly developed libdha kernel helper. Look at kernelhelper/dhahelper.c)
