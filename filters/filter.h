/**
 * A filter converts input frames to output frames (mp_frame, usually audio or
 * video data). It can support multiple inputs and outputs. Data always flows
 * through mp_pin instances.
 *
 * --- General rules for data flow:
 *
 * All data goes through mp_pin (present in the mp_filter inputs/outputs list).
 * Actual work is done in the filter's process() function. This function
 * queries whether input mp_pins have data and output mp_pins require data. If
 * both is the case, a frame is read, filtered, and written to the output.
 * Depending on the filter type, the filter might internally buffer data (e.g.
 * things that require readahead). But in general, a filter should not request
 * input before output is needed.
 *
 * The general goal is to reduce the amount of data buffered. This is why
 * mp_pins buffer at most 1 frame, and the API is designed such that queued
 * data in pins will be immediately passed to the next filter. If buffering is
 * actually desired, explicit filters for buffering have to be introduced into
 * the filter chain.
 *
 * Typically a filter will do something like this:
 *
 *  process(struct mp_filter *f) {
 *      if (!mp_pin_in_needs_data(f->ppins[1]))
 *          return; // reader needs no output yet, so stop filtering
 *      if (!have_enough_data_for_output) {
 *          // Could check mp_pin_out_request_data(), but often just trying to
 *          // read is enough, as a failed read will request more data.
 *          struct mp_frame fr = mp_pin_out_read_data(f->ppins[0]);
 *          if (!fr.type)
 *              return; // no frame was returned - data was requested, and will
 *                      // be queued when available, and invoke process() again
 *           ... do something with fr here ...
 *      }
 *      ... produce output frame (i.e. actual filtering) ...
 *      mp_pin_in_write(f->ppins[1], output_frame);
 *  }
 *
 * Simpler filters can use utility functions like mp_pin_can_transfer_data(),
 * which reduce the boilerplate. Such filters also may not need to buffer data
 * as internal state.
 *
 * --- Driving filters:
 *
 * The filter root (created by mp_filter_create_root()) will internally create
 * a graph runner, that can be entered with mp_filter_graph_run(). This will
 * check if any filter/pin has unhandled requests, and call filter process()
 * functions accordingly. Outside of the filter, this can be triggered
 * implicitly via the mp_pin_* functions.
 *
 * Multiple filters are driven by letting mp_pin flag filters which need
 * process() to be called. The process starts by requesting output from the
 * last filter. The requests will "bubble up" by iteratively calling process()
 * on each filter, which will request further input, until input on the first
 * filter's input pin is requested. The API user feeds it a frame, which will
 * call the first filter's process() function, which will filter and output
 * the frame, and the frame is iteratively filtered until it reaches the output.
 *
 * --- General rules for thread safety:
 *
 * Filters are by default not thread safe. However, some filters can be
 * partially thread safe and allow certain functions to be accessed from
 * foreign threads. The common filter code itself is not thread safe, except
 * for some utility functions explicitly marked as such, and which are meant
 * to make implementing threaded filters easier.
 *
 * (Semi-)automatic filter communication such as pins must always be within the
 * same root filter. This is meant to help with ensuring thread-safety. Every
 * thread that wants to run filters "on its own" should use a different filter
 * graph, and disallowing different root filters ensures these graphs are not
 * accidentally connected using non-thread safe mechanisms. Actual threaded
 * filter graphs would use several independent graphs connected by asynchronous
 * helpers (such as mp_async_queue instead of mp_pin connections).
 *
 * --- Rules for manual connections:
 *
 * A pin can be marked for manual connection via mp_pin_set_manual_connection().
 * It's also the default. These have two uses:
 *
 *      1. filter internal (the filter actually does something with a frame)
 *      2. filter user manually feeding/retrieving frames
 *
 * Basically, a manual connection means someone uses the mp_pin_in_*() or
 * mp_pin_out_*() functions on a pin. The alternative is an automatic connection
 * made via mp_pin_connect(). Manual connections need special considerations
 * for wakeups:
 *
 * Internal manual pins (within a filter) will invoke the filter's process()
 * function, and the filter polls the state of all pins to see if anything
 * needs to be filtered or requested.
 *
 * External manual pins (filter user) require the user to poll all manual pins
 * that are part of the graph. In addition, the filter's wakeup callback must be
 * set, and trigger repolling all pins. This is needed in case any filters do
 * async filtering internally.
 *
 * --- Rules for filters with multiple inputs or outputs:
 *
 * The generic filter code does not do any kind of scheduling. It's the filter's
 * responsibility to request frames from input when needed, and to avoid
 * internal excessive buffering if outputs aren't read.
 *
 * --- Rules for async filters:
 *
 * Async filters will have a synchronous interface with asynchronous waiting.
 * They change mp_pin data flow to being poll based, with a wakeup mechanism to
 * avoid active waiting. Once polling results in no change, the API user can go
 * to sleep, and wait until the wakeup callback set via mp_filter_create_root()
 * is invoked. Then it can poll the filters again. Internally, filters use
 * mp_filter_wakeup() to get their process() function invoked on the user
 * thread, and update the mp_pin states.
 *
 * For running parts of a filter graph on a different thread, f_async_queue.h
 * can be used.
 *
 * With different filter graphs working asynchronously, reset handling and start
 * of filtering becomes more difficult. Since filtering is always triggered by
 * requesting output from a filter, a simple way to solve this is to trigger
 * resets from the consumer, and to synchronously reset the producer.
 *
 * --- Format conversions and mid-stream format changes:
 *
 * Generally, all filters must support all formats, as well as mid-stream
 * format changes. If they don't, they will have to error out. There are some
 * helpers for dealing with these two things.
 *
 * mp_pin_out_unread() can temporarily put back an input frame. If the input
 * format changed, and you have to drain buffered data, you can put back the
 * frame every time you output a buffered frame. Once all buffered data is
 * drained this way, you can actually change the internal filter state to the
 * new format, and actually consume the input frame.
 *
 * There is an f_autoconvert filter, which lets you transparently convert to
 * a set of target formats (and which passes through the data if no conversion
 * is needed).
 *
 * --- Rules for format negotiation:
 *
 * Since libavfilter does not provide _any_ kind of format negotiation to the
 * user, and most filters use the libavfilter wrapper anyway, this is pretty
 * broken and rudimentary. (The only thing libavfilter provides is that you
 * can try to create a filter with a specific input format. Then you get
 * either failure, or an output format. It involves actually initializing all
 * filters, so a try run is not cheap or even side effect free.)
