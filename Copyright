mpv is a fork of mplayer2, which is a fork of MPlayer.

mpv as a whole is licensed under the GNU General Public License GPL version 2
or later (called GPLv2+ in this document, see LICENSE.GPL for full license
text) by default, or the GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL version 2 or
later (LGPLv2.1+ in this document, see LICENSE.LGPL for full license text) if
built with the --enable-lgpl configure switch.

Most source files are LGPLv2.1+ or GPLv2+, but some files are available under
more liberal licenses, such as BSD, MIT, ISC, and possibly others. Look at the
copyright header of each source file, and grep the sources for "Copyright" if
you need to know details. C source files without Copyright notice are usually
licensed as LGPLv2.1+. Also see the list of files with specific licenses below
(not all files can have a standard license header).

All new contributions must be LGPLv2.1+ licensed. Using a more liberal license
compatible to LGPLv2.1+ is also ok.

If changes are done on GPL code, must come with the implicit agreement that the
project can relicense the changes to LGPLv2.1+ at a later point without asking
the contributor. This is a safeguard for making potential relicensing of
remaining GPL code to LGPLv2.1+ easier.

For information about authors and contributors, consult the git log, which
contains the complete SVN and CVS history as well.

"v2.1+" in this context means "version 2.1 or later".

Some libraries are GPLv2+ or GPLv3+ only. Building mpv with Samba support makes
it GPLv3+.

mpv can be built as LGPLv2.1+ with the --enable-lgpl configure option. To add
a LGPL mode to mpv, MPlayer code had to be relicensed from GPLv2+ to LGPLv2.1+
by asking the MPlayer authors for permission. Since permission could not be
obtained from everyone, LGPL mode disables the following features, some of
them quite central:
- no audio filtering, which breaks: --volume, --af, replaygain, pitch
  correction, fine control about downmix/upmix/resampling behavior
- Linux X11 video output
- Linux audio output via ALSA (PulseAudio works)
- BSD audio output via OSS
- NVIDIA/Linux hardware decoding (vdpau, although CUDA usually works)
- many builtin video filters (use libavfilter instead)
- automatic rotation and stereoscopic video handling
- Linux TV input
- the add/cycle and sub-add/audio-add/sub-remove/audio-remove commands
- video format conversion (if not supported by the VO)
- minor features: jack, DVD, CDDA, SMB, CACA, legacy direct3d VO
Some of these will be fixed in the future. The lack of the add/cycle commands
makes this particularly useless for CLI mode, and most of the appeal of LGPL
is for libmpv anyway. Thus it's not recommended to build mpv CLI in LGPL mode
at all.

The following files are still GPL only (--enable-lgpl disables them):

The following files contain some optional GPL code (--enable-lgpl disables it):

    input/cmd_list.c                potentially some commands
    options/parse_commandline.c     dvd:// expansion
    player/audio.c                  libaf glue code
    player/osd.c                    OSD level 3
    player/command.c                add/cycle command, possibly sub-add command

None of the exceptions listed above affect the final binary if it's built as
LGPL. Linked libraries still can affect the final license (for example if
FFmpeg was built as GPL).
