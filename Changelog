    if it runs well, then mplayer -o gl should work, too.
    it works on G400+Utah-GLX, but segfaults in the G400 driver of X 4.0.2/DRI.
    try it with different cards/drivers, and please report me the results.
  - benchmarking in gltest.c: calculate fps and process times
  - ASF seeking v0.01-pre0.1 :)



MPlayer v0.11-pre16: Feb 4, 2001
  ACM fixed
  - Win32/ACM audio codec fixed (most important for ASF with DivX audio):
    There was an output buffer size problem with the Win32/ACM audio codec
    at low bitrates (usually used for ASF files with DivX audio)
    Input and output buffer sizes are now queryed, problem solved :)
  - SDL support compiling hint by Michael Durller added to the FAQ
  - opendivx support in ASF files   [Grard Lantau]
  - ./configure & Makefiles patch by Aaron Hope applied.
    (adds --with-win32libdir and fixes --with-x11libdir)
  - ./configure fixed, now it defaults to /usr/lib/win32 if detection failed



MPlayer v0.11-pre15: Feb 2, 2001
  ASF sync fixed
  - ASF parser: now supports other than 0x5D segments  [Dirk Vornheder]
  - new ASF PTS reading: sync works now, including fps...
    (-fps no longer required!)  [thanks again to Eugene Kuznetsov for docs!]



MPlayer v0.11-pre14: Feb 1, 2001
  small fixes, ASF sync v0.1 :)
  - version number incremented :)))
  - libvo / Xv driver swapped red-blue fixed
  - ASF timestamps implemented - now ASF A-V should be in sync if you
    specify the correct fps at commandline (-fps), +-1 fps allowed...
    [i haven't yet found method to get fps out from ASF headers :(((]
  - some error and consistency checking into demux_asf
    if you see many warning! messages playing an ASF file, then contact
    me and upload the file (first 1MB is enough if it represents the problem)
    Don't forget: there is no public doc about the ASF file format, so
    everything we know is suspected and can be wrong... without your help
    we will never have a working ASF player...
  - ASF fragment offset checks disabled for grouping...



MPlayer v0.11-pre13: Jan 31, 2001
  libvo changes, MPEG bitrate, VCD fix, ASF grouping
  - libvo: draw_slice() interface changed, now it has src stride[3] and
    destination rect dimension (w,h,x,y)
    It's able to blit whole frames, not only 16-pixel slices...
  - libmpeg2 and opendivx codec changed to use new draw_slice()
    -> opendivx extra 64-pixel width band at right disappeared!
  - MPEG bitrate fix: if picture->bitrate==0x3FFFF (means "unspecified" ?)
    then using standard VCD bitrate (75*2324 bytes/sec)
    -> fixed seeking for those MPEGs with "16MBit/s" bitrate...
  - drivers/sis_vid: video4linux interface disabled
  - broken VCD playing fixed: stream_reset shouldn't seek to 0x0...
    [bugreport: Kang Sun]
  - asf_parser: grouping implemented!  [test file provided by Gabucino :))]



MPlayer v0.11-pre12: Jan 30, 2001
  ./configure fixes, improved odivx-encoding, streaming fixes
  - ./configure: use /tmp/main$$.c instead of /tmp.main.c, and
    remove file after tests  [SaPe]
  - ./configure: trying the gcc optimize options and fall back on 'pentium'
    if it fails (useful for people with old gcc and new CPU :))
  - removed -fomit-frame-pointer from OPTFLAGS at config.mak
  - version number incremented [Gabucino]
  - odivx encoder fix: allow long (longer than xxxx.avi) destination filenames
    (sizeof() changed to strlen()...)  [Gabucino]
  - AVI writer - overwrite disabled (exits with error message if destination
    file already exists...)  [Gabucino]
  - use -divxq to set encoding bitrate (in bits (not kbits!) default: 780000)
  - no audio decoding if -encode option is used
  - audio streaming disabled if -nosound specified (setting audio_id to -2)
  - fast MPEG-ES detection (doesn't read the whole MPEG-PS file)
  - compile-time option to disable using soundcard driver's select()
    (required for some people with buggy/pre-alpha/etc sound driver...)



MPlayer v0.11-pre11: Jan 29, 2001
  streaming fixes, ASF support pre, indeo5 fix
  - asf/asfinfo.c improved: now dumps streams to files - needs testing!
    (it's ready to be converted to ASF demuxer and integrated into MPlayer)
  - stream.c / stream_reset() fix: now really seeks back to position 0!
  - ASF file format detection added (no ASF reading yet!!!)
  - ASF demultiplexer added, changes in demuxer.c to handle fragmented packets
  > it plays ASF video well, but still has problems with DivX/WMA audio. :(((
  - indeo 5 playing fixed (removed ICDECOMPRESS_UPDATE from flags)
  - xmga resizing problems with some window managers, so default order is
    changed xmga,xma... to mga,xmga,...
  - found gcc bug: compiling MPlayer with flags
    OPTFLAGS=-O -g -march=i686 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math
    causes image sizes negating -> mga_vid kernel driver Oops... :(((
  - runaway.bride.sample.avi seeking segfault discovered: AC3 resync fails :(
  - improved signal handling: module name is now printed. audio_resync added.
  - RGB opendivx encoding implemented, now AVI->opendivx is possible.


MPlayer v0.11-pre10: Jan 22, 2001
  OpenDivX encoding, streaming fixes, AVI seek fixes
  - new libvo driver: odivx  (OpenDivX File Writer)
  - AVI file writing support, new option:  -encode filename
    to encode an MPEG/VOB/VCD to opendivx:
      mplayer file1.mpg -encode file2.avi -o odivx -nosound
    (sound encoding/copying is not yet supported)
  - libvo: default driver priority changed to: xmga,mga,syncfb,3dfx,xv,x11,gl
  - AVI writer: index support
  - small fixes in AVI writer to be compliant (adjusted chunk/list lengths)
  - demuxer.c: stream buffering fixes:
    - missing {} in mplayer.c occurring audio reads when has_audio=0
    - reordered packet reader and pack count checks -> no more unwanted EOF
    - added 4MB buffer memory usage limit to demuxed streams
  - CPU flags in ./configure changed:
      k7 -> k6  (current stable gcc doesn't support k7)
      386,486 -> i386,i486    [Balazs Tibor]
  - demux_avi: index check now accepts (raw.len+1)==idx.len  [Balazs Tibor]
  - FAQ added

    **  Now we are done with planned features & urgent fixes,   **
    **  it's time for final testing and then the 0.11 release!! **



MPlayer v0.11-pre9: Jan 18, 2001
  OpenDivX fixes,speedup
  - solved OpenDivX width problem (stride=width+(Quality?0:64))
    now -divxq 0 works, and 0 is the default
  - libvo call moved out from my_convert_yuv() so it can be measured (CPU %)
  - IDCT code ported from libmpeg2 -> much faster OpenDivX decoding



MPlayer v0.11-pre8: Jan 18, 2001
  SDL fixes, OpenDivX support
  - added -I/usr/X11R6/include to libvo CFLAGS
  - (removed later: applied libvo SDL driver fixes by Jeffrey Boser)
  - OpenDivX support, initial hack, maybe not working for you...
    (I need testfiles, I have only one)
    use -divxq option to adjust quality (1..29 works), 1=default



MPlayer v0.11-pre7: Jan 14, 2001
  SDL support
  - ported SDL driver from mpeg2dec/libvo (current CVS)
    (it's slower than internal X11 driver, but supports software scaling!)
  - fixed SDL driver to support -fs and pass keyboard events
  - SDL driver changed to support YV12 and YUY2 formats instead of IYUV
    (now works with DivX files, too)
  - 'q' (Quit) disabled in SDL fullscreen mode (because it's impossible
    to restore screen before exiting so it gets into an unusable state now)



MPlayer v0.11-pre6: Jan 14, 2001
  audio fix
  - fixed video_out_xv.c compilation problems [bugreport: Kalle Mellerup]
  - modified audio playing: always keep buffer (both internal and card's)
    filled using select() -> -alsa audio delays should be fixed.
  - updated DOCS/AUTHORS and DOCS/README



MPlayer v0.11-pre5: Jan 12, 2001
  xmmp audio support, applied Pontscho's libvo patch
  - xmmp audio driver support by Arthur Kleer
  - new video_out driver by Pontscho: xmga  (Matrox G200/G400 only!)
    It does same under X 3.3.x what Xv extension does under X 4.0.x!
    (you will have a moveable/resizeable window but see a YUV video
     overlay in it using color keying)
  - added keyboard event support in X11 windows    [Pontscho]
    (using mplayer_[put|get]_key() in codecctrl.c)



MPlayer v0.11-pre4: Jan 6, 2001
  x11 driver fixes, 15/16bpp support
  - version in version.h fixed :))) [Pontscho]
  - inttypes.h moved to DOCS/ (copy back to the root if you need it)
  - depth calculation in vo_init() changed (Pontscho's version couldn't
    differenciate between 15 and 16bpp)
  - x11 driver now uses vo_init() instead of get_depth()
  - yuv2mmx: 15bpp not really supported -> removed from list, now
    conversion is done (well) by the C code -> MPEG play in 15bpp works!
  - AVI playing support added in 15bpp (memcpy)
  - AVI playing support added in 16bpp (C 15->16 converter by me)
  - AVI playing support added in 16bpp (MMX 15->16 converter by Strepto)
  - libvo/x11: yuv2rgb used MMX code on non-MMX CPUs, too!!! fixed...
  - all x11 modes tested (and MPEG/24bpp byteorder fixed):
                  MPEG:            AVI/VfW:
        15bpp    C convert        memcpy
        16bpp    MMX/C convert    MMX/C convert
        24bpp    C convert        memcpy
        32bpp    MMX/C convert    memcpy / C conv.
    => now all the movie types are viewable using the -o x11 driver!



MPlayer v0.11-pre3: Jan 5, 2001
  MPEG fixes, fullscreen support
  - vertical.mpg serious libvo (x11,gl) segfaults fixed:
    yuv2rgb_mmx requires one more lines that vertical image size...
    fixed (allocating memory for width*(height+1)).   [bug report: Gabucino]
  - Pontscho's fullscreen patch applied!
    Using option -fs will maximize window size (for all resizeable drivers
    including mga!) and disable window decorations (x11,Xv,gl only)
  - simple inttypes.h included for libc5 (and glibc2.0, too?) users
  - homepage updates (links changed ftp->http)



MPlayer v0.11-pre2: Jan 4, 2001
  better user messages, MP3 codec selection, demuxer changes
  - w32codec.zip restored at the FTP site (somehow it got damaged...)
  - added version.h, and used its content everywhere
  - 'premature end-of-file' problem fixed: freeing audio buffers and
    setting d_audio->id=-2 if has_audio==0  [bugreport by Dmitri Pogosyan]
  - some more messages added if verbose>=1
  - demuxer.c: error message printed if A or V chunk buffer is full
    'mplayer test.avi -aid -2' still not works without option '-nosound'
  - adding new config.h option to set default MP3 audio codec (mpg123/l3codeca)
    ./configure selects mp3lib only if you have 3DNow!   [idea: Gabucino]
  - automatic fall back on mp3lib/mpg123 if l3codeca.acm can't be loaded/inited



MPlayer v0.11-pre1:
  AVI sync fixes
  - AVI audio seeking improvements: now using nBlockAlign value to seek
    inside the chunk, so DivX audio works without big delays!!!
  - AVI PTS calculation modified: counting video PTS when skip_video_frames>0
    so new audio PTS values will be correct. Solved many sync probs!
  - A-V sync with AVI files fixed!
    Now only the Desperado-trailer has 1.0 sec delay after seeking.
  - fixed AVI sync in -bps mode, too! :)  (perfect except that Desperado AVI)



MPlayer v0.10: Jan 1, 2001  "The new year" release!
  - testing
  - docs changed
  - it's time to release and remove the old buggy 0.09 version...
  - release!!!



MPlayer v0.10-pre8:  libvo/x11 changes
  - libvo: x11/xv driver split into x11 and xv drivers
  - libvo: DUMMY_VO_FUNC removed from driver sources
  - libvo: default driver order changed, because some users with software-only
           OpenGL thought that this 'slow' player can only play at 1-3fps :)



MPlayer v0.10-pre7: Dec 31, 2000
  libmpeg2 interface changes, display size/area changes, AVI fixes
  - libmpeg2/decode.c modified:
    - removed unused OMS and mpeg2dec stuff
    - decode_data rewritten, now works like parse_es.c
      => doesn't copy any data -> faster and less memory usage
  - mplayer.c sends code 0x1FF after every frame, so libmpeg2 knows
    when to display it
  - mplayer.c: in_frame flag fixes, didn't work well with MPEG-2 streams
    (because there is a 0x1B2 chunk between 0x100 and 0x101)
  - 'picture' changed from static to shmem-allocated
    -> better picture after codec restart (tested with JapAd.mpg)
    -> keep information of the header changes (after init)
  - MPEG image size changed, now only the real part of frame is displayed
    (no more green stripe at the bottom)
    - picture struct: new fields: display_picture_width/height
    - image buffer allocation (shmem) is done by decode.c instead of libvo
  - new option:  -xy <value>  (resize both x/y direction)
    if value<=8  ->  x_scale = y_scale = value
    else         ->  x_size=value  y_size=aspectratio*x_size
  - mplayer.c: video output moved out from AVI/MPG init sections and
    now it's common code (added movie_size_x/y variables and out_fmt global)
  - new keys:
    ESC       => quit
    + and -   => adjust audio delay +- 0.1 second
    k         => kill/restart the MPEG codec process (for testing)
  - codec control interface changed: wait for syncword after (re)start
    to avoid receiving old frames => it's stable again!
  - removed (now unused) allocate/free image buffer code from libvo
  - mplayer: new internal variable for video format: has_video
       0 = none (unused yet)
       1 = MPEG-1/2 video
       2 = Win32/VfW video codec
  - config.h has defaults for bps-based AVI sync and ALSA timer code options:
     #undef AVI_SYNC_BPS  => now it's disabled by default!!! use -bps to enable
     #define ALSA_TIMER   => now it's enabled by default!!! use -noalsa to dis.
  - help updated
  - prints max compressed framesize at exit (both AVI & MPEG)
  - AVI audio seeking fixed: some ACM codecs (DivX audio and ms-adpcm)
    can't seek inside a chunk, they are only able to play whole chunks.
    Current audio seeking has changed to seek inside the chunk only if the
    codec supports it (only internal codecs and ACM/MP3 allows it).
  - AVI: audio delay correction if seeking inside the chunk is not possible



MPlayer v0.10-pre6: Dec 24, 2000 "Xmas edition"
  MPEG signal & EOF fixes
  - ./configure: k6_mtrr (2.4.test11+) added [Pontscho]
  - `term destroys if mplayer (MPG) called from mc.ext` bug fixed:
    added sighandler to the 3rd process (MPEG codec) to avoid sig. recursion
  - better output at exit (handled now by exit_player())
  - MPEG EOF problem (codec restart) fixed: added EOF detection to parse_es.c
  - internal flag 'current_module' added to get more info at segfaults
    (contains module number where the segfault occurred)
  - audio detection changed: using afm=4 (Win32/ACM) for MP3 audio (AVI files)
    (you MUST have l3codeca.acm at /usr/lib/win32, or you have to use '-afm 1')



MPlayer v0.10-pre5: Dec 22, 2000
  flipping fixed
  - AVI image flipping reworked:
    - new flag: avi_header.flipped, TRUE if upside-down
    - image flipping code removed/disabled from libvo modules
    - duplicate flip_page() calls removed (overload with x11 and mga)
  - aLaw audio codec (AVI id 0x06) added (uses code from XAnim source)



MPlayer v0.10-pre4:
  test release, small fixes
  - video_out driver <-> codec incompatibility message changed
  - fixed the config.format bug in drivers/mga_vid_test, so it works again!
    [thanks to David Whysong]
  - libmpeg2 upgraded



MPlayer v0.10-pre3: Dec 10, 2000
  test release, verbose mode, new docs
  - new option:  -v  =  increment verbosity level
    (debug printf's changed to verbose level-dependent)
    - default level: 0, only some informal output
    - init debug:    1, some basic debug infos, AVI header, function values
    - player debug:  2, print AVI indexes, chunk inputs, more debug infos
    - parser debug:  3, prints everything related to input parsers
    to increment verbose level, use multiple -v options (-v -v -v for level 3)
  - bitrate calculation for AVI files
  - README rewritten, added Troubleshooting and Bugreports sections
  - TVout directory added (only the scripts)



MPlayer v0.10-pre2: Dec 8, 2000
  bugfix test release, bps-sync enabled
  - AVI: supporting both 0-based and movi-based index types (autodetect)
  - AVI: tested with VBR audio: plays well with -mc 0 option, seek doesn't
    work yet   [thanks to Alan Chen for testfile]
  - AVI: A-V sync to avg. byte/sec implemented (again) and enabled by default
    (disable with -nobps if you want)
  - ./configire: 3rd name ('kni') of the P3 added. Where is the compatibility?
  - useless '\' removed from libac3/Makefile  [Otvos Ferenc]



MPlayer v0.10-pre1: Dec 5, 2000
  test release, players merged!!!
  - avip and mpegp have been merged to a single binary called 'mplayer'
    - file type detection (AVI/MPEG-PS/MPEG-ES/Other)
    - no redundant code (common code for common jobs)
    - big format-dependent codes moved to functions (separated files)
    - better error messages, removed some debug stuff, code cleanups
  - old libmpeg2 version removed from source tree
  - help texts merged (help_avi+help_mpg -> help_mp)
  - new options:  -x <x> -y <y>     = scale image (if selected driver supports)
    if value<=8 then image size will be multiplied by value, otherwise
    image size will be scaled to <value> pixels.
    For example:
      2x ZOOM:  mplayer -x 2 -y 2 test.mpg
      800x600:  mplayer -x 800 -y 600 test.mpg
    [default values are still configurable at compile-time, see config.h]
  - TV project (not finished) codebase added (see tvision.c, or: make tvision)



MPlayer v0.09: Dec 5, 2000
  Beta release [same as 0.09-pre3]
  - version changed in the files
  - docs updated



MPlayer v0.09-pre3: Dec 3, 2000
  bugfix test-release, X11 support testing
  - fixed the  if [ -z $pparam ]  bug in ./configure  [Christian Birchinger]
  - many changes in AVI seek code, resulting in near-perfect seeking now!
    current method calculates absolute audio position, so with VBR audio it
    doesn't work yet...
  - avip: Xv support (YUY2 image format)
  - avip: X11 support (24 & 32 bpp only, BGR format)
    I need a very fast 15->16bpp converter for 16bpp support... anyone helps?



MPlayer v0.09-pre2:
  bugfix test-release
  - removed unnecessary code from libmpeg2/header.c
    Walken told me that standard MPG/VOB streams must NOT use framerate
    and bitrate extension... and the ext. id check is done by the caller.
  - CRC support to mp3lib's MPEG audio layer-2 decoder
    thanks for bug report & test file to Samson



MPlayer v0.09-pre1: Dec 1, 2000
  bugfix test-release
  - imported new libmpeg2 files (under testing...)
  - GL renderer flickering bug fixed (MMX missing emms() between yuv2rgb and
    glTexSubImage(), bug triggered by new Utah-GLX code)
    [thanks to Christian Birchinger]



MPlayer v0.08: Nov 27, 2000
  Index support, AVI seeking, DLL loader fix, compilation fixes
  - Added support for chunk index usage (disable with -noidx option)
  - Removed code optimization flags from loader/Makefile because
    it segfaults if compiled optimized (it does some hacks with
    pointers, maybe the reordered code confuses it)
  - added new tool called aviparse  (read and check AVI file structure)
  - indexed and raw chunk info comparing, bad chunks dropped
  - termcap usage is optional (for those Debian users without termcap)
  - #if HAVE_* fixed (to #ifdef HAVE_*)
  - ./configure supports new /proc/cpuinfo (2.4.0-test11)
      - sse is called 'sse' again
      - 'flags' field renamed to 'features'
  - Xv benchmark results added to DOCS/SPEED
  - AVI seeking (and other goodies, pause etc) implemented
    no PTS resync after seek yet.
  - default video_out driver changed from 'mga' to the first available driver
    new driver priority:  mga_vid, opengl, x11



MPlayer v0.07: Nov 21, 2000
  Easier compile
  - Added Pontscho's ./configure script (it's modified a lot)
  - Updated makefiles, and tested a lot :)
  - Updated DOCS/INSTALL



MPlayer v0.06: Nov 20, 2000
  Better codec selection
  - AVI audio&video codec selection moved to new codecs.c file,
    loader/driver.c and loader/afl.c modified for this
  - YUV support fixed, codecs.c setup flags to handle YUV properly
    YUV works fine with DivX, MPEG-4, cvid, and upside-down iv50
  - DOCS/INSTALL updated
  - DOCS/SPEED updated, DivX benchmarks added



MPlayer v0.05: Nov 18, 2000
  Merged with MPEGplayer 0.90pre6, first public release of AVI player
  - code merged with mpegplayer, new Makefile, some small modifications
  - docs updated and moved to DOCS



MPlayer v0.04: Nov 17, 2000
  YUV (YUY2) support with DivX 3.11 DLL, some code cleanup, preview-release



MPlayer v0.03: Nov 14, 2000



MPlayer v0.01: Nov 11, 2000
  first preview version based on new MPEGplayer's codebase.
  it contains the Win32 loader from avifile, and can decode DivX 3.11 video.



mpg12play v0.9-v0.95pre5: Oct 21-Nov 2, 2000
       MPEG codec was libmpeg2 (mpeg2dec) by Aaron Holtzman & Michel
       Lespinasse. It's great, optimized very fast C code with perfect
       image quality and 100% MPEG standard conformance.



mpg12play v0.5-v0.87: Sep 28-Oct 20, 2000
       MPEG codec replaced with DVDview by Dirk Farin, it was great
       stuff, but it was slow and was written in C++ (I hate C++!!!)



mpg12play v0.1-v0.3: Sep 22-25, 2000
       The first try, hacked together in half an hour! I've used libmpeg3
       from www.heroinewarrior.com up to the version 0.3, but there were
       image quality and speed problems with it.
