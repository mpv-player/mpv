# This file contains all bindings that were removed or changed
# after a certain release.
# If you want MPlayer bindings, use mplayer-input.conf

# Pick the bindings you want back and add them to your own input.conf. Append
# this file to your input.conf if you want them all back:
#
#    cat restore-old-bindings.conf >> ~/.config/mpv/input.conf
#
# Older installations use ~/.mpv/input.conf instead.
