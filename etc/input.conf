# mpv input control file
#
# You are able to redefine default keyboard/joystick/mouse/LIRC bindings, or
# add new ones here.
# See DOCS/man/en/input.rst for possible commands that can be bound.
# Also see mpv --input-cmdlist for other possible options.
# The file should be placed in the $HOME/.mpv directory.
#
# mpv --input-test --pause dummy.mkv can be used to test which commands keys are
# bound to.
#
# If you wish to unbind a key, use key ignore.
# e.g. ENTER ignore
#
# Note that merely removing default key bindings from this file won't remove
# the default bindings mpv was compiled with, unless
#   --no-input-default-bindings
# is specified.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments. Use SHARP to assign the # key.
#
# Strings need to be quoted and escaped:
# KEY  show_text "This is a single backslash: \\ and a quote: \" !"
#
# You can use modifier-key combinations like Shift+Left or Ctrl+Alt+x with
# modifiers Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Meta, but note that currently reading
# key combinations is only supported through the video windows of certain
# output drivers (not in output windows of other drivers or in a terminal).
