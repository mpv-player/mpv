  <description summary="color management protocol">
    The aim of the color management extension is to allow clients to know
    the color properties of outputs, and to tell the compositor about the color
    properties of their content on surfaces. Doing this enables a compositor
    to perform automatic color management of content for different outputs
    according to how content is intended to look like.

    The color properties are represented as an image description object which
    is immutable after it has been created. A wl_output always has an
    associated image description that clients can observe. A wl_surface
    always has an associated preferred image description as a hint chosen by
    the compositor that clients can also observe. Clients can set an image
    description on a wl_surface to denote the color characteristics of the
    surface contents.

    An image description includes SDR and HDR colorimetry and encoding, HDR
    metadata, and viewing environment parameters. An image description does
    not include the properties set through color-representation extension.
    It is expected that the color-representation extension is used in
    conjunction with the color management extension when necessary,
    particularly with the YUV family of pixel formats.

    Recommendation ITU-T H.273
    "Coding-independent code points for video signal type identification"
    shall be referred to as simply H.273 here.

    The color-and-hdr repository
    (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pq/color-and-hdr) contains
    background information on the protocol design and legacy color management.
    It also contains a glossary, learning resources for digital color, tools,
    samples and more.

    The terminology used in this protocol is based on common color science and
    color encoding terminology where possible. The glossary in the color-and-hdr
    repository shall be the authority on the definition of terms in this
    protocol.

        Compositors should make sure that all content is anchored, meaning that
        an input signal level of 'reference_lum' on one image description and
        another input signal level of 'reference_lum' on another image
        description should produce the same output level, even though the
        'reference_lum' on both image representations can be different.

        If 'max_lum' is less than the 'reference_lum', or 'reference_lum' is
        less than or equal to 'min_lum', the protocol error invalid_luminance is
        raised.

        The minimum luminance is multiplied by 10000 to get the argument
        'min_lum' value and carries precision of 4 decimals. The maximum
        luminance and reference white luminance values are unscaled.

        If the primary color volume luminance range and the reference white
        luminance level have already been set on this object, the protocol error
        already_set is raised.

        This request can be used if the compositor advertises
        xx_color_manager_v4.feature.set_luminances. Otherwise this request
        raises the protocol error unsupported_feature.

      <description summary="mastering display primaries as chromaticity coordinates">
        Provides the color primaries and white point of the mastering display
        using CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates. This is compatible with the
        SMPTE ST 2086 definition of HDR static metadata.

        The mastering display primaries define the target color volume.

        If mastering display primaries are not explicitly set, the target color
        volume is assumed to be equal to the primary color volume.

        The target color volume is defined by all tristimulus values between 0.0
        and 1.0 (inclusive) of the color space defined by the given mastering
        display primaries and white point. The colorimetry is identical between
        the container color space and the mastering display color space,
        including that no chromatic adaptation is applied even if the white
        points differ.

        The target color volume can exceed the primary color volume to allow for
        a greater color volume with an existing color space definition (for
        example scRGB). It can be smaller than the primary color volume to
        minimize gamut and tone mapping distances for big color spaces (HDR
        metadata).

        To make use of the entire target color volume a suitable pixel format
        has to be chosen (e.g. floating point to exceed the primary color
        volume, or abusing limited quantization range as with xvYCC).

        Each coordinate value is multiplied by 10000 to get the argument value
        to carry precision of 4 decimals.

        If mastering display primaries have already been set on this object, the
        protocol error already_set is raised.

        This request can be used if the compositor advertises
        xx_color_manager_v4.feature.set_mastering_display_primaries. Otherwise
        this request raises the protocol error unsupported_feature. The
        advertisement implies support only for target color volumes fully
        contained within the primary color volume.

        If a compositor additionally supports target color volume exceeding the
        primary color volume, it must advertise
        xx_color_manager_v4.feature.extended_target_volume. If a client uses
        target color volume exceeding the primary color volume and the
        compositor does not support it, the result is implementation defined.
        Compositors are recommended to detect this case and fail the image
        description gracefully, but it may as well result in color artifacts.
