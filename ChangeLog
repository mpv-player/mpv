  fixes
  - asf "missing video stream" fixed (stream id & 0x7F)  [Christoph H. Lampert]
  - added GL-test directory, it contains source and compiler script of a
    very simple open-gl texture updating (glTexSubImage) test program.
    if it runs well, then mplayer -o gl should work too.
    it works on G400+Utah-GLX, but segfaults in the G400 driver of X 4.0.2/DRI.
    try it with different cards/drivers, and please report me the results.
  - benchmarking in gltest.c: calculate fps and process times
  - .asf seeking v0.01-pre0.1 :)

mplayer v0.11-pre16: Feb  4  2001
  ACM fixed
  - Win32/ACM audio codec fixed (most important for asf with divx audio):
    There was an output buffer size problem with the Win32/ACM audio codec
    at low bitrates (usually used for .asf files with divx audio)
    Input and output buffer sizes are now queryed, problem solved :)

  small fixes, asf sync v0.1 :)
  - version number incremented :)))
  - libvo / Xv driver swapped Red-Blue fixed
  - asf timestamps implemented - now asf A-V should be in sync if you
    specify the correct fps at commandline (-fps), +-1 fps allowed...
    [i haven't yet found method to get fps out from asf headers :(((]
  - some error and consistency checking into demux_asf
    if you see many warning! messages playing an .asf file, then contact
    me and upload the file (first 1MB is enough if it represents the problem)
    Don't forget: there is no public doc about the .asf file format, so 
    everything we know is suspected and can be wrong... without your help
    we never will have working .asf player...
  - asf fragment offset checks disabled for grouping...

mplayer v0.11-pre13: Jan 31  2001
  libvo changes, mpeg bitrate, vcd fix, asf grouping
  - libvo: draw_slice() interface changed, now it has src stride[3] and
    destination rect dimension (w,h,x,y)
    It's able to blit whole frames, not only 16-pixel slices...
  - libmpeg2 and opendivx codec changed to use new draw_slice()
    -> opendivx extra 64-pixel width band at right disappeared!
  - mpeg bitrate fix: if picture->bitrate==0x3FFFF (means "unspecified" ?)
    then using standard VCD bitrate (75*2324 bytes/sec)
    -> fixed seeking for those mpegs with "16MBit/s" bitrate...
  - drivers/sis_vid: video4linux interface disabled
  - broken VCD playing fixed: stream_reset shouldn't seek to 0x0...
    [bugreport: Kang Sun]
  - asf_parser: grouping implemented!  [test file provided by Gabucino :))]

mplayer v0.11-pre12: Jan 30  2001
  ./configure fixes, improved odivx-encoding, streaming fixes
  - ./configure: using /tmp/main$$.c instead /tmp.main.c, and
    remove file after tests  [SaPe]
  - ./configure: trying the gcc optimize options and fallback to 'pentium'
    if fails (useful for people with old gcc and new cpu :))
  - removed -fomit-frame-pointer from OPTFLAGS at config.mak
  - version number incremented [Gabucino]
  - odivx encoder fix: allow long (longer than xxxx.avi) destination filenames
    (sizeof() changed to strlen()...)  [Gabucino]
  - avi writer - overwrite disabled (exits with error message if destination
    file already exists...)  [Gabucino]
  - use -divxq to set encoding bitrate (in bits (no kbits!) default: 780000)

  - .asf file format detection added (no .asf reading yet!!!)
  - .asf demultiplexer added, changes in demuxer.c to handle fragmented packets
  > it plays .asf video well, but still has problems with divx/wma audio. :(((
  - indeo 5 playing fixed (removed ICDECOMPRESS_UPDATE from flags)
  - xmga resizing problems with some window managers, so default order is
    changed xmga,xma... to mga,xmga,...
  - found gcc bug: compiling MPlayer with flags 
    OPTFLAGS=-O -g -march=i686 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math
    cause image sizes negating -> mga_vid kernel driver Oops... :(((
  - runaway.bride.sample.avi seeking segfault discovered: AC3 resync fails :(

    - missing {} in mplayer.c occuring audio reads when has_audio=0
    - reordered packet reader and pack count checks -> no more unwanted EOF
    - added 4MB buffer memory usage limit to demuxed streams
  - CPU flags in ./configure changed:
      k7 -> k6  (current stable gcc doesn't supports k7)
      386,486 -> i386,i486    [Balazs Tibor]
  - demux_avi: index check now accepts (raw.len+1)==idx.len  [Balazs Tibor]
  - FAQ added

  - OpenDivX support, initial hack, maybe not work for you...
    (I need testfiles, I have just only one)
    use -divxq option to adjust quality (1..29 works), 1=default

mplayer v0.11-pre7: Jan 14  2001
  SDL support
  - ported SDL driver from mpeg2dec/libvo (currect CVS)
    (it's slower than internal X11 driver, but supports software scaling!)
  - fixed SDL driver to support -fs and pass keyboard events
  - SDL driver changed to support YV12 and YUY2 formats instead of IYUV
    (now works with DivX files too)
  - 'q' (Quit) disabled in SDL fullscreen mode (because it's impossible
    to restore screen before exiting so it gets unusable state now)

mplayer v0.11-pre6: Jan 14  2001
  audio fix
  - fixed video_out_xv.c compiling problems [bugreport: Kalle Mellerup]
  - modified audio playing: always keep buffer (both internal and card's)
    filled using select() -> -alsa audio delays should be fixed.
  - updated DOCS/AUTHORS and DOCS/README

mplayer v0.11-pre5: Jan 12  2001
  xmmp audio support, applied Pontscho's libvo patch
  - xmmp audio driver support by Arthur Kleer
  - new video_out driver by Pontscho: xmga  (Matrox G200/G400 only!)
    It does same under X 3.3.x what Xv extension does under X 4.0.x!
    (you will have a moveable/resizeable window but see an YUV video
     overlay in it using color keying)
  - added keyboard event support in X11 windows    [Pontscho]
    (using mplayer_[put|get]_key() in codecctrl.c)

mplayer v0.11-pre4: Jan  6  2001
  x11 driver fixes, 15/16bpp support
  - version in version.h fixed :))) [Pontscho]
  - inttypes.h moved to DOCS/ (copy back to the root if you need it)
  - depth calculation in vo_init() changed (Pontscho's version couldn't
    make difference between 15 and 16bpp)
  - x11 driver now uses vo_init() instead of get_depth()
  - yuv2mmx: 15bpp not really supported -> removed from list, now
    conversion is done (well) by the C code -> MPEG play in 15bpp works!
  - avi playing support added in 15bpp (memcpy)
  - avi playing support added in 16bpp (C 15->16 converter by me)
  - avi playing support added in 16bpp (MMX 15->16 converter by Strepto)
  - libvo/x11: yuv2rgb used MMX code on non-MMX CPUs too!!! fixed...
  - all x11 modes tested (and mpeg/24bpp byteorder fixed):
                  MPEG:            AVI/VfW:
        15bpp    C convert        memcpy
        16bpp    MMX/C convert    MMX/C convert
        24bpp    C convert        memcpy
        32bpp    MMX/C convert    memcpy / C conv.
    => now all the movie types are viewable using the -o x11 driver!

mplayer v0.11-pre3: Jan  5  2001
  mpeg fixes, fullscreen support
  - vertical.mpg serious libvo (x11,gl) segfaults fixed:
    yuv2rgb_mmx requires one more lines that vertical image size...
    fixed (allocating memory for width*(height+1)).   [bugreport: Gabucino]
  - Pontscho's fullscreen patch applied!
    Using option -fs will maximize window size (for all resizeable drivers
    including mga!) and disable window decorations (x11,Xv,gl only)
  - simple inttypes.h included for libc5 (and glibc2.0 too?) users
  - homepage updates (links changed ftp->http)

mplayer v0.11-pre2: Jan  4  2001
  better user messages, mp3 codec selection, demuxer changes
  - w32codec.zip restored at the FTP site (somehow it damaged...)
  - added version.h, and used its content everywhere
  - 'premature end-of-file' problem fixed: freeing audio buffers and
    setting d_audio->id=-2 if has_audio==0  [bugreport by Dmitri Pogosyan]
  - some more messages added if verbose>=1
  - demuxer.c: error message printed if A or V chunk buffer is full
    'mplayer test.avi -aid -2' still not works without option '-nosound'
  - adding new config.h option to set default MP3 audio codec (mpg123/l3codeca)
    ./configure selects mp3lib only if you have 3Dnow    [idea: Gabucino]
  - automatic fallback to mp3lib/mpg123 if l3codeca.acm can't be loaded/inited

mplayer v0.11-pre1:
  AVI sync fixes
  - AVI audio seeking improvements: now using nBlockAlign value to seek
    inside the chunk, so divx audio works without big delays!!!
  - AVI PTS calculation modified: counting video PTS when skip_video_frames>0
    so new audio PTS values will be correct. Solved many sync probs!
  - A-V sync with AVI files fixed!
    Now only the Desperado-trailer has 1.0 sec delay after seeking.
  - fixed AVI sync in -bps mode too! :)  (perfect except that Desperado avi)

mplayer v0.10: Jan  1  2001  "The new year" release!
  - testing
  - docs changed
  - it's time to release and remove the old buggy 0.09 version...
  - release!!!
  
mplayer v0.10-pre8:  libvo/x11 changes
  - libvo: x11/xv driver separated to x11 and xv drivers
  - libvo: DUMMY_VO_FUNC removed from driver sources
  - libvo: default driver order changed, because some users with software-only
           opengl though that this 'slow' player can only play at 1-3fps :)

mplayer v0.10-pre7: Dec 31  2000
  libmpeg2 interface changes, display size/area changes, AVI fixes
  - libmpeg2/decode.c modified:
    - removed unused OMS and mpeg2dec stuff
    - decode_data rewritten, now works like parse_es.c
      => doesn't copy any data -> faster and less memory usage
  - mplayer.c sends code 0x1FF after every frame, so libmpeg2 knows
    when has to display it
  - mplayer.c: in_frame flag fixes, didn't work well with mpeg2 streams
    (because there is a 0x1B2 chunk between 0x100 and 0x101)
  - 'picture' changed from static to shmem-allocated
    -> better picture after codec restart (tested with JapAd.mpg)
    -> keep information of the header changes (after init)
  - mpeg image size changed, now only the real part of frame is displayed
    (no more green strip at the bottom)
    - picture struct: new fields: display_picture_width/height
    - image buffer allocation (shmem) is done by decode.c instead of libvo
  - new option:  -xy <value>  (resize both x/y direction)
    if value<=8  ->  x_scale = y_scale = value
    else         ->  x_size=value  y_size=aspectratio*x_size
  - mplayer.c: video output moved out from avi/mpg init sections and
    now it's common code (added movie_size_x/y variables and out_fmt global)
  - new keys:
    ESC       => quit
    + and -   => adjust audio delay +- 0.1 second
    k         => kill/restart the mpeg codec process (for testing)
  - codec control interface changed: wait for syncword after (re)start
    to avoid receiving old frames => it's stable again!
  - removed (now unused) allocate/free image buffer code from libvo
  - mplayer: new internal variable for video format: has_video
       0 = none (unused yet)
       1 = mpeg 1/2 video
       2 = win32/VfW video codec
  - config.h has defaults for bps-based AVI sync and ALSA timer code options:
     #undef AVI_SYNC_BPS  => now it's disabled by default!!! use -bps to enable
     #define ALSA_TIMER   => now it's enabled by default!!! use -noalsa to dis.
  - help updated
  - prints max compressed framesize at exit (both avi & mpeg)
  - AVI audio seeking fixed: some ACM codecs (divx audio and ms-adpcm)
    can't seek inside a chunk, they are only able to play whole chunks.
    Current audio seeking has changed to seek inside the chunk only if the
    codec supports it (only internal codecs and ACM/mp3 allows it).
  - AVI: audio delay correction if can't seek inside the chunk

mplayer v0.10-pre6: Dec 24  2000 "Xmas edition"
  mpeg signal & EOF fixes
  - ./configure: k6_mtrr (2.4.test11+) added [Pontscho]
  - `term destroys if mplayer (mpg) called from mc.ext` bug fixed:
    added sighandler to the 3rd process (mpeg codec) to avoid sig. recursion
  - better output at exit (handled now by exit_player())
  - mpeg EOF problem (codec restart) fixed: added EOF detection to parse_es.c
  - internal flag 'current_module' added to get more info at segfaults
    (contains module number where the segfault occured)
  - audio detection changed: using afm=4 (Win32/ACM) for MP3 audio (AVI files)
    (you MUST have l3codeca.acm at /usr/lib/win32, or you have to use '-afm 1')

mplayer v0.10-pre5: Dec 22  2000
  flipping fixed
  - AVI image flipping reworked:
    - new flag: avi_header.flipped, TRUE if upside-down
    - image flipping code removed/disabled from libvo modules
    - duplicate flip_page() calls removed (overload with x11 and mga)
  - aLaw audio codec (AVI id 0x06) added (uses code from xanim source)

mplayer v0.10-pre4: ???
  test release, small fixes
  - video_out driver <-> codec incompatibility message changed
  - fixed the config.format bug in drivers/mga_vid_test, so it works again!
    [thanks to David Whysong]
  - libmpeg2 upgraded

mplayer v0.10-pre3: Dec 10  2000
  test release, verbose mode, new docs
  - new option:  -v  =  increment verbose level
    (debug printf's changed to verbose level-dependent)
    - default level: 0, only some informal output
    - init debug:    1, some basic debug infos, avi header, function values
    - player debug:  2, print avi indexes, chunk inputs, more debug infos
    - parser debug:  3, prints everything related to input parsers
    to increment verbose level, use multiple -v options (-v -v -v for level-3)
  - bitrate calculation for AVI files
  - README rewritten, added Troubleshooting and Bugreports sections
  - TVout directory added (only the scripts)

mplayer v0.10-pre2: Dec  8  2000
  bugfix test release, bps-sync enabled
  - avi: supporting both 0-based and movi-based index types (autodetect)
  - avi: tested with VBR audio: plays well with -mc 0 option, seek doesn't
    work yet   [thanks to Alan Chen for testfile]
  - avi: A-V sync to avg. byte/sec implemented (again) and enabled by default
    (disable with -nobps if you want)
  - ./configire: 3rd name ('kni') of the P3 added. Where is the compatibility?
  - useless '\' removed from libac3/Makefile  [Otvos Ferenc]

mplayer v0.10-pre1: Dec  5  2000
  test release, players merged!!!
  - avip and mpegp has been merged to a single binary called 'mplayer'
    - file type detection (AVI/MPEG-PS/MPEG-ES/Other)
    - no redundant code (common code for common jobs)
    - big format-dependent codes moved to functions (separated files)
    - better error messages, removed some debug stuff, code cleanups
  - old libmpeg2 version removed from source tree
  - help texts merged (help_avi+help_mpg -> help_mp)
  - new options:  -x <x> -y <y>     = scale image (if selected driver supports)
    if value<=8 then image size will be multiplied by value, otherwise
    image size will be scaled to <value> pixels.
    For example:
      2x ZOOM:  mplayer -x 2 -y 2 test.mpg
      800x600:  mplayer -x 800 -y 600 test.mpg
    [default values are still configurable at compile-time, see config.h]
  - TV project (not finished) codebase added (see tvision.c, or: make tvision)

mplayer v0.09: Dec  5  2000
  Beta release [same as 0.09-pre3]
  - version changed in the files
  - docs updated  
  
mplayer v0.09-pre3: Dec  3  2000
  bugfix test-release, X11 support testing
  - fixed the  if [ -z $pparam ]  bug in ./configure  [Christian Birchinger]
  - many changes in AVI seek code, resulting near-perfect seeking now!
    current method calc absolute audio position, so with VBR audio it
    doesn't work yet...
  - avip: Xv support (YUY2 image format)
  - avip: X11 support (24 & 32 bpp only, BGR format)
    I need a very fast 15->16bpp converter for 16bpp support... anyone helps?

mplayer v0.09-pre2:
  bugfix test-release 
  - removed unnecessary code from libmpeg2/header.c
    Walken told me that standard mpg/vob streams must NOT use framerate
    and bitrate extension... and the ext. id check is done by the caller.
  - CRC support to mp3lib's mpeg audio layer-2 decoder
    thanks for bugreport & testfile to Samson

mplayer v0.09-pre1: Dec  1  2000
  bugfix test-release
  - imported new libmpeg2 files (under testing...)
  - GL renderer flickering bug fixed (MMX missing emms() between yuv2rgb and
    glTexSubImage(), bug triggered by new Utah-GLX code)
    [thanks for Christian Birchinger]

mplayer v0.08: Nov 27  2000
  Index support, avi seeking, DLL loader fix, compilation fixes
  - Added support for chunk index usage (disable with -noidx option)
  - Removed code optimization flags from loader/Makefile because
    it segfaults if compile optimized code (it does some hacks with
    pointers, maybe the reordered code confuses it)
  - added new tool called aviparse  (read and check avi file structure)
  - indexed and raw chunk info comparing, bad chunks dropped
  - termcap usage is optional (for those debian users without termcap)
  - #if HAVE_* fixed (to #ifdef HAVE_*)
  - ./configure supports new /proc/cpuinfo (2.4.0-test11)
      - sse is called 'sse' again
      - 'flags' field renamed to 'features'
  - Xv benchmark results added to DOCS/SPEED
  - avi seeking (and other goodies, pause etc) implemented
    no PTS resync after seek yet.
  - default video_out driver changed from 'mga' to the first available driver
    new driver priority:  mga_vid, opengl, x11

mplayer v0.07: Nov 21  2000
  Easier compile
  - Added Pontscho's ./configure script (it's modified a lot)
  - Updated makefiles, and tested a lot :)
  - Updated DOCS/INSTALL

mplayer v0.06: Nov 20  2000
  Better codec selection
  - avi audio&video codec selection moved to new codecs.c file,
    loader/driver.c and loader/afl.c modified for this
  - yuv support fixed, codecs.c setup flags to handle yuv properly
    yuv works fine with divx, mpeg4, cvid, and upside-down iv50
  - DOCS/INSTALL updated
  - DOCS/SPEED updated, DivX benchmarks added

mplayer v0.05: Nov 18  2000
  Merged with MPEGplayer 0.90pre6, first public release of AVI player
  - code merged with mpegplayer, new Makefile, some small modifications
  - docs updated and moved to DOCS

mplayer v0.04: Nov 17  2000
  YUV (yuy2) support with divx 3.11 dll, some code cleanup, preview-release

mplayer v0.03: Nov 14  2000

mplayer v0.01: Nov 11  2000
  first preview version based on new MPEGplayer's codebase.
  it contains the win32 loader from avifile, and can decode divx 3.11 video.

mpg12play v0.9-v0.95pre5: Oct 21-Nov 2, 2000
       Mpeg codec was libmpeg2 (mpeg2dec) by Aaron Holtzman & Michel
       Lespinasse. It's great, optimized very fast C code with perfect
       image quality and 100% MPEG standard conformance.

mpg12play v0.5-v0.87: Sep 28-Oct 20, 2000
       Mpeg codec replaced with DVDview by Dirk Farin, it was a great
       stuff, but it was slow and was written in C++ (I hate C++!!!)

mpg12play v0.1-v0.3: Sep 22-25, 2000
       The first try, hacked together in a half hour! I've used libmpeg3
       from www.heroinewarrior.com up to the version 0.3, but there were
       image quality and speed problems with it.
